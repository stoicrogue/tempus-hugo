      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondrous item, uncommon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This inky-dark bag glimmers softly in daylight and shines like a star in darkness, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Inside the bag is complete darkness. The bag has 3 charges, and regains all spent charges daily at dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can expend 1 charge to reach inside and catch a handful of starlight like sand. This starlight can be used in either of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weapon (dagger), rare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use an action to cause a necrotic aura to coat the blade. The aura remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 necrotic damage. The dagger can&amp;rsquo;t be used this way again until the next dawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Figurine of Wondrous Power (Onyx Dog)</title>
      <link>/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-onyx-dog/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondrous Item, rare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;figurine of wondrous power&lt;/strong&gt; is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a creature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Iron bands of binding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondrous Item, rare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;restrained&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered a creature of such sorrow and powerful longing. If only I could share the depth of his darkness with the realm…”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I can&amp;rsquo;t be the only one to have been engaged by the beauty of his darkness. I must find someone who understands my experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“the dusk lord?!? What a joke. His suffering would surely please the great shadow… would it not?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I knew it! My lord’s hatred for the ‘god’ runs deep. I must find a way to make them suffer. The curse the Weaver taught me would be perfect!!! Time to gather my supplies. Now… what face to wear when I go to town? The artist? The beggar? The warrior? No…the singer would be just the thing!  She always gets attention and I feel like showing off a bit”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The sword was crafted by the finest elven blacksmiths and enchanted by powerful elven mages during a time when the spread of the undead threatened the Summer Court.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sword&amp;rsquo;s first owner was a legendary elven knight, Eirik of the Summer Court, who led the charge against the undead hordes that threatened the safety of the Summer Court. Eirik was a skilled swordsman and a devoted protector of his people. With the help of Summer&amp;rsquo;s Edge, he and his fellow knights were able to successfully repel the undead invasion and restore peace to the Summer Court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Xolthos,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our progress is swift, but vigilance is essential. The Shadow Dragon&amp;rsquo;s freedom hinges on the weakening of the barrier. We must secure the leyline temples where the barrier is anchored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Winter Court&amp;rsquo;s crystal has already been damaged. The next target lies within the territory of the Summer Court, where the master smiths reside. Disrupt their leyline crystal, and our victory draws closer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure the elimination of any who might interfere, particularly those who bear the marks of the Dusk Lord. Their resolve must be shattered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
