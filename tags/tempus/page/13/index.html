            <h2 id="-prologue--tannis-and-the-blacksmiths-plea">📍 <em>Prologue – Tannis and the Blacksmith’s Plea</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The party meets in the Raven’s Perch Tavern</strong> in the quiet village of Tannis and is introduced to key NPCs: Lerissa (retired adventurer), Serenity (mysterious singer), Hurmur (dwarven archaeologist), and Jax (Night Talons thief).</li>
<li><strong>Blacksmith Sig Rockwell bursts in</strong>, begging for help to rescue his kidnapped daughter, Winry. He offers his finest work as payment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-quest-rescue-the-blacksmiths-daughter">🛡️ <em>Quest: Rescue the Blacksmith’s Daughter</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracked the captors north</strong>, crossing into the enchanted Elven forest and finding a strange <strong>obsidian standing stone</strong> with a vision of landmarks to the NW and SE.</li>
<li>Discovered an <strong>ancient tomb of the Order of Seasons</strong>, a knightly group sworn to fight darkness.</li>
<li>Rescued Winry from a <strong>dark ritual</strong> conducted by goblins and a bugbear of the <strong>Cult of the Eclipse</strong>, who served a mysterious “Lady of the Eclipse.”</li>
<li>Retrieved a <strong>Cult medallion</strong> marked with the phrase: <em>“Darkness will descend once again.”</em></li>
<li>Found a <strong>hidden chamber of five knights</strong>, and recovered magical gear and the <strong>broken pieces of a longsword</strong> marked with solar and avian symbols — possibly a legendary weapon.</li>
<li>Returned Winry to her father, <strong>receiving custom magical gear</strong> and a promise from Sig to call in a future favor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-darkness-falls-on-tannis">🌒 <em>The Darkness Falls on Tannis</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared findings with Lerissa</strong>, who revealed legends of the <em>Knight of Ravens</em>, a hero of the Order of Seasons. She directed the party to seek the sage <strong>Vidrir</strong> in the Shimmerwood, suggesting they bring a cask of her ale as a goodwill offering.</li>
<li>Noted strange celestial behavior: <strong>half the stars missing</strong> from the night sky.</li>
<li><strong>Woke to panic</strong> — the village engulfed in <strong>magical darkness</strong> impenetrable by light or darkvision.</li>
<li>Fought off <strong>shadowy hands</strong> trying to drag villagers into the abyss and discovered a <strong>magical barrier</strong> trapping the town.</li>
<li>Found temporary safety at Lerissa’s tavern, then crossed the village to the <strong>church of the Dusk Lord</strong>, the only sanctuary emitting light.</li>
<li><strong>Met Father Samael</strong>, who recalled showing a <strong>black-haired woman</strong> (presumably Serenity) his holy symbol — now missing.</li>
<li><strong>Explored the church catacombs</strong>, avoided a deadly shadow entity, and found their way to a secret chamber.</li>
<li>Discovered and <strong>parleyed with the Arbiter</strong>, an <strong>Angel of Justice</strong>. She had created the barrier to contain the spreading corruption and was preparing a purge.</li>
<li>Convinced her to delay her ritual and <strong>earned her favor</strong>: she <strong>marked them with her symbol</strong>, granting safe passage and the ability to commune with her.</li>
<li>The Arbiter <strong>destroyed remaining shadows</strong> in the village but maintained the barrier until the source of the corruption could be found.</li>
<li><strong>Skreek claimed a +1 Shield of the Dusk Lord</strong> from the crypt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-journey-to-the-sage-vidrir">🌿 <em>Journey to the Sage, Vidrir</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Used the Arbiter’s holy mark</strong> to leave Tannis and travel through the Shimmerwood.</li>
<li><strong>Met the sage Vidrir</strong>, a friendly ally of Lerissa with mysterious insight and purple-winged raven familiars.</li>
<li>Vidrir confirmed the broken sword is <strong>Summer’s Edge</strong>, a legendary blade once wielded by the Summer Court’s champion during the great war against the undead. Only <strong>elven master smiths</strong> could hope to reforge it.</li>
<li>Revealed the <strong>Eclipse medallion</strong> was magically <strong>trackable</strong>, with the signal leading northwest.</li>
<li>Skreek inquired about his stolen relic; Vidrir mentioned rumors of <strong>djinn in the southern desert</strong> searching for elemental artifacts.</li>
<li>When Vidrir held Summer’s Edge, it <strong>reacted faintly</strong>, hinting at a dormant soul within the blade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-aid-the-pixies-and-uncover-a-cult-plot">🧚 <em>Aid the Pixies and Uncover a Cult Plot</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tracked the medallion’s signal northwest, coinciding with Slumpet’s vision of the <strong>silver maple</strong> seen through the standing stone.</li>
<li><strong>Slumpet befriended Fannie the pixie</strong>, who warned of a <strong>colorless region of forest</strong> growing eerily still.</li>
<li>Fannie asked for help rescuing kidnapped pixies from <strong>Darklings</strong> allied with the <strong>Cult of the Eclipse</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Toby, turned into a dinosaur by Fannie</strong>, rampaged through the cultist camp. The party rescued the pixies and recovered:
<ul>
<li>Cult religious texts referencing a “<strong>Great Shadow</strong>”</li>
<li>Two <strong>Daggers of Darkness</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>note from ‘L’</strong> about empowering a cultist via ritual, exploiting growing fear in the region</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-greyscale-cabin-and-the-truth-about-serenity">🕯️ <em>The Greyscale Cabin and the Truth about Serenity</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Entered the corrupted woods and found a <strong>cabin guarded by a Flameskull</strong>. After defeating it, Slumpet kept the skull as a trophy.</li>
<li>Discovered signs of <strong>Serenity’s presence</strong> in the cabin and were attacked by a <strong>Rug of Smothering</strong>, later named “Sassy Tassels.”</li>
<li>Found a <strong>defiled altar to a shadow dragon</strong> with a <strong>magical crystal orb</strong> and a diorama of Tannis. Using their holy marks, they summoned the <strong>Arbiter</strong>, who confirmed this site as the source of the Dusk Lord’s wrath and cleansed it. She departed to lift the barrier over Tannis.</li>
<li>The next morning, the <strong>hag Serenity revealed herself</strong> and demanded the return of the orb. The party refused, and combat broke out.</li>
<li>Shad’s <strong>charm person spell unexpectedly succeeded</strong>, pacifying Serenity and allowing them to gather intel:
<ul>
<li>Serenity served a caster named <strong>the Weaver</strong>, a master of fear and illusion.</li>
<li>Serenity cursed Tannis to earn favor with <strong>Nidhogg</strong>, a <strong>shadow dragon</strong> who <strong>hates the Dusk Lord</strong>.</li>
<li>The Weaver was responsible for the <strong>illusion-based massacre of Shad’s village</strong>, using a false vision of Nidhogg.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party <strong>fled while Serenity was still charmed</strong>, with Slumpet carrying the orb.</li>
<li>Along the way, the <strong>Flameskull revived itself</strong> as <strong>Francis</strong> and struck a deal with the party: in exchange for adventure and action, he would provide his <strong>laser-eye beams and arcane knowledge</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-shadow-of-nidhogg-revealed">🐉 <em>The Shadow of Nidhogg Revealed</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Returned to <strong>Vidrir’s grove</strong> to rest and regroup. Francis the Flameskull was <strong>repelled by undead wards</strong>, revealing Vidrir’s home was protected against such creatures.</li>
<li>Vidrir examined <strong>Serenity’s dark orb</strong>, identifying it as a <strong>seeing stone</strong>—useful for communication, tracking, and divination.</li>
<li>He grew deeply alarmed when learning Serenity had contacted <strong>Nidhogg</strong>, the shadow dragon sealed in the <strong>Shadowfell</strong> by the Order of Seasons during a great war centuries ago.</li>
<li>Vidrir’s cryptic remarks hinted he may have <strong>personally fought in that war</strong>, revealing a depth of history and power previously unspoken.</li>
<li>Advised the party to seek out the <strong>Winter Court</strong> for further knowledge of Nidhogg, the orb, and the reforging of <strong>Summer’s Edge</strong>. He gifted them his <strong>Order of Seasons medallion</strong> to gain an audience with the Lady of Winter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-first-contact-with-the-winter-court">❄️ <em>First Contact with the Winter Court</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Traveled north toward the <strong>silver maple</strong> tree. En route, the party:
<ul>
<li>Defeated a <strong>Redcap assassin</strong> hired to stop them.</li>
<li>Spotted a <strong>strange feline predator</strong> tearing holes in reality and avoided its path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Found a <strong>Winter Court standing stone</strong> and made peaceful contact with <strong>elven rangers</strong> by showing Vidrir’s medallion.</li>
<li>Arrived at the <strong>Winter Court embassy</strong>, a well-kept elven village with shops, an inn (<em>The Restful Buck</em>), and a faint sci-fi aesthetic powered by blue crystal tech.</li>
<li>Shad performed at the inn, and the party learned:
<ul>
<li>The Lady of Winter was <strong>Alora</strong>.</li>
<li>Her daughter, <strong>Olivia</strong>, had recently been <strong>poisoned</strong>—possibly by a creature called a <strong>Bandersnatch</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gained a private audience with Alora after <strong>Skreek healed Olivia</strong> with Lay on Hands. Grateful, Alora opened up about the weakening of the <strong>interplanar barrier</strong>, which was allowing monsters to breach into the material plane.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-quest-hunt-the-bandersnatch">🦷 <em>Quest: Hunt the Bandersnatch</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Accepted Alora’s offer to <strong>hunt the Bandersnatch</strong> that poisoned Olivia.</li>
<li>Used clever tactics and <strong>Slumpet’s squirrel network</strong> to bait and trap the creature. Despite its poison gas and claws, the party was victorious.</li>
<li>Returned the beast’s <strong>severed head</strong> to Alora, who rewarded them each with a <strong>powerful magic item</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Slumpet</strong>: <em>Relentless Hunter</em> (shortbow with <em>Hunter’s Mark</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Shad</strong>: <em>Fochlucan Bandore</em> (bardic instrument)</li>
<li><strong>Toby</strong>: <em>Blinkback Belt</em> (auto-retrieving thrown weapons)</li>
<li><strong>Skreek</strong>: <em>Frostbrand Scimitar</em> (cold damage)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learned more about the <strong>barrier’s origin</strong>, which was forged by Alora’s mother using ancient power. Since no one of her lineage has inherited her gift, the barrier is weakening.</li>
<li>Alora asked the party to investigate a nearby <strong>leyline temple</strong> that sustains part of the barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Trius</strong>, Alora’s eldest daughter and a paladin wielding a <strong>moonblade</strong>, made an impression on the group—especially Shadicar. Though intrigued by their quest, she initially declined to join them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-journey-to-the-winter-leyline-temple">🛡️ <em>Journey to the Winter Leyline Temple</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>After a night of rest and <strong>unsettling dreams of Serenity reclaiming the orb</strong>, the party prepared to depart. With some persuasion and the promise of excitement, <strong>Trius</strong> agreed to accompany them to the leyline temple.</li>
<li>The party traveled east on horseback (with Trius riding a <strong>majestic unicorn</strong>) toward a <strong>temple of ancient origin</strong> embedded in the hillside — <strong>unlike any elven or dwarven structure they&rsquo;d seen</strong>.</li>
<li>At the entrance, a magical voice demanded proof of worthiness:
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadicar</strong>: a bardic song of Elven legend</li>
<li><strong>Skreek</strong>: scroll proving his lineage</li>
<li><strong>Slumpet</strong>: failed with Serenity’s orb, succeeded with Alora’s gifted bow</li>
<li><strong>Toby</strong>: blood sacrifice</li>
<li><strong>Trius</strong>: her family’s Moonblade<br>
These offerings were accepted, and the temple opened like a <strong>mechanical iris</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-temple-trials-of-the-ancient-order">⚔️ <em>Temple Trials of the Ancient Order</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Chamber</strong>: Greeted by a <strong>holographic knight</strong> requesting a duel. <strong>Skreek</strong> met the challenge and defeated the guardian honorably, unlocking the next door.</li>
<li><strong>Second Chamber</strong>: A perilous 300-foot bridge over a chasm with tiles bearing <strong>seasonal glyphs</strong>. Missteps triggered <strong>laser traps</strong> from the walls. With flight, acrobatics, and deduction, the party made it across.</li>
<li><strong>Final Chamber</strong>: A breathtaking nexus of power, centered on a <strong>giant purple leyline crystal</strong> surrounded by six hovering <strong>arcane focus crystals</strong>.
<ul>
<li>The <strong>glyphs</strong> referenced &ldquo;planes,&rdquo; &ldquo;barrier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;leyline.&rdquo;</li>
<li>One of the six crystals was <strong>cracked and flickering</strong>, indicating a possible failure in the arcane network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Slumpet recorded the runes</strong> by making a rubbing, and <strong>Skreek contacted the Arbiter</strong>, who explained that <strong>leylines channel the raw magic of the world</strong>, which can be used for power, communication, or traversal.</li>
<li>With no further threats or puzzles, the party exited the temple, ready to <strong>report their findings to Alora</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-final-showdown-with-serenity">🌑 <em>Final Showdown with Serenity</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>On the road back from the leyline temple, the forest’s <strong>colors drained into grayscale</strong>, and the party unexpectedly arrived at <strong>Serenity’s cabin</strong> once more.</li>
<li>Serenity, revealing her true <strong>night hag form</strong>, demanded her crystal orb and launched an ambush.</li>
<li><strong>Trius joined the battle</strong>, sword drawn and projecting a <strong>mental battle hymn</strong> that inspired the party.</li>
<li>Serenity animated the <strong>party’s shadows</strong> as enemies and revealed her <strong>“cloak” was a manta-like creature</strong>, capable of absorbing damage and creating illusory copies.</li>
<li>After a <strong>brutal, all-hands battle</strong>, Serenity and the shadow creatures were slain. Her cloak escaped.</li>
<li>Shad used a scroll of <strong>Speak with Dead</strong>, and Serenity grudgingly answered:
<ul>
<li>She was <strong>over 300 years old</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Weaver</strong> destroyed Shad’s village “for amusement”</li>
<li><strong>She wasn’t responsible</strong> for the Elven barrier’s weakening</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She refused to share the <strong>Weaver’s location</strong> or her <strong>breakfast recipe</strong>.</li>
<li>The party looted her body, finding:
<ul>
<li>An <strong>emerald ring</strong> that opens a <strong>small storage dimension</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>gold necklace</strong> that <strong>protects the mind from magical probing</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After looting her cabin, they <strong>burned both the body and the building</strong> to ensure Serenity would not return.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-reporting-to-alora-and-discovering-the-larger-plan">🧭 <em>Reporting to Alora and Discovering the Larger Plan</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Returned to the Winter Court and reported both:
<ul>
<li>Serenity’s permanent defeat</li>
<li>The <strong>damaged leyline crystal</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alora was troubled by the crack but <strong>didn’t know how to repair it</strong>.</li>
<li>As a reward, she gifted the party a <strong>silver teleportation ring</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When attuned to an <strong>obsidian standing stone</strong>, it allows teleportation between attuned stones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The next morning, <strong>Arch Magus Levi</strong> joined Alora in briefing the party:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>barrier is anchored by four leyline temples</strong>, one in each seasonal domain.</li>
<li><strong>Alora’s mother’s journal</strong> referenced an ancient site called <strong>The Chained Library</strong>, likely the original source of the barrier ritual.</li>
<li>The Chained Library may still exist and may <strong>seek out forbidden artifacts</strong> like the orb.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During this meeting, <strong>Slumpet stole a map of the Dwarven capital</strong> from Alora’s desk, raising questions about her connection to the Dwarves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-journey-to-the-autumn-court">🍂 <em>Journey to the Autumn Court</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>On the road east, the party was <strong>ambushed by fey thieves</strong> (Quicklings and Aridni), but prevailed and recovered stolen coin.</li>
<li>Discovered a <strong>Torii gate and standing stone</strong> at the tranquil entrance to the <strong>Autumn Court</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-darkness-at-the-fall-festival">🍁 <em>Darkness at the Fall Festival</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrived during a seasonal festival at the <strong>Aki Matsuri beer garden</strong>, hosted by the <strong>earth genasi monk Hencelle</strong>, the &ldquo;Master of Feasts.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Befriended <strong>Ali</strong>, a bounty hunter working for the secretive information guild , the <strong>Massa’Ista</strong>; his captive <strong>Arden</strong> may help identify magic items.</li>
<li><strong>Xolthos, a black dragonborn sorcerer and agent of the Eclipse</strong>, disrupted the festival with an ominous speech:
<ul>
<li>Proclaimed the <strong>return of Nidhogg</strong></li>
<li>Warned of more <strong>attacks on leyline temples</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After <strong>banishing Shad mid-taunt</strong>, Xolthos was defeated in a tough battle. Slumpet&rsquo;s <strong>stardust</strong> prevented him from using shadow magic.</li>
<li>Looted magic items from Xolthos:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiny dragon figurine</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invisibility ring</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enchanted robes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magic staff</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Found a <strong>letter from the Weaver</strong>, confirming:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Winter leyline crystal</strong> was already damaged</li>
<li>The <strong>Summer Court’s leyline</strong> is the <strong>next target</strong></li>
<li>All <strong>marked by the Dusk Lord</strong> are enemies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-audience-with-farkris--entry-to-the-autumn-temple">🧠 <em>Audience with Farkris &amp; Entry to the Autumn Temple</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Gained an audience with <strong>Lord Farkris</strong>, leader of the Autumn Court:
<ul>
<li>Regretted failing to make peace with Nidhogg centuries ago</li>
<li>Shocked to learn the barrier is weakening — Alora had not warned him</li>
<li>Granted permission to explore the <strong>Autumn Leyline Temple</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proved their worth to a <strong>guardian treant</strong> by <strong>saving a baby unicorn</strong> from bloodthirsty vines during a dire wolf ambush</li>
<li>Gained entrance to the temple through a <strong>hill peeled open by ancient magic</strong></li>
<li>Solved a <strong>rotating seasonal puzzle</strong> depicting the <strong>cycle of autumn</strong></li>
<li>Inside, found the leyline crystal and its six focus crystals <strong>intact and stable</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>Camped in the treant’s grove, then scouted east toward <strong>Summer’s lands</strong></li>
<li>Used the standing stone near a massive <strong>silver birch tree</strong> to <strong>attune their teleportation ring</strong>, then returned to the Aki Matsuri for one last restful night (and <strong>drink roulette</strong>).</li>
<li>Returned to the Summer border — teleportation <strong>miraculously cured Shad’s hangover</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-battlefield-of-the-eclipse">⚔️ <em>The Battlefield of the Eclipse</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Discovered a site with <strong>arcane runes</strong> burned into the ground — likely the <strong>battlefield where Nidhogg was sealed</strong></li>
<li>Encountered <strong>cultists performing a ritual</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Party ambushed the enemy</li>
<li>Defeated a mage named <strong>Kharvax</strong>, along with an ogre and mercenaries</li>
<li>Francis delighted in laser-eye-beaming the foes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two mercs surrendered and shared cult plans in exchange for their lives</li>
<li><strong>Shad used Mantle of Whispers</strong> to absorb Kharvax’s shadow and learned:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Weaver’s stronghold is in the Feywild</strong></li>
<li>They hope to use the old <strong>Nidhogg sealing ritual</strong> to <strong>enhance summoning magic</strong></li>
<li>Kharvax had tested this by summoning a basilisk, which killed some cultists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Looted:
<ul>
<li><strong>+1 Vampiric Scythe</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grimoire of the Eclipse</strong>, containing:
<ul>
<li><em>Summon Shadowspawn</em></li>
<li><em>Shadow Blade</em></li>
<li><em>Contact Other Plane</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-arrival-in-the-summer-court">☀️ <em>Arrival in the Summer Court</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>After leaving the ancient battlefield, the party reached the <strong>Summer Court</strong>, known for its <strong>competitive culture</strong> and bold street food.</li>
<li>Discovered a <strong>standing stone near the coliseum</strong> and attuned it for teleportation.</li>
<li>Visited <strong>Ember’s Embrace</strong>, a lively inn run by <strong>Serra Flamekissed</strong>, a fire genasi who introduced them to <strong>flaming shots</strong>.</li>
<li>The next day, met with <strong>Lady Sylvia</strong> of the Summer Court, who asked them to check on the <strong>Summer Leyline Temple</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-summer-temple-sabotage-and-the-duel-with-manus">🔥 <em>Summer Temple Sabotage and the Duel with Manus</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Found the temple <strong>already breached</strong>; two <strong>guardian constructs</strong> were destroyed by <strong>fire and ice magic</strong>.</li>
<li>Discovered the <strong>leyline crystal chamber</strong> had one of its eight rune crystals <strong>entirely missing</strong>.</li>
<li>Outside, encountered <strong>Manus</strong>, a trickster warrior posing as Trius. He:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mocked the Weaver and the cult</strong> despite seeming to be allied with the cult</li>
<li>Wants to test his skills against strong opponents,  but the Weaver would only fight Manus after the cult accomplished its goal.</li>
<li><strong>Offered the crystal</strong> if they could <strong>land one blow</strong> on him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party struggled to even touch him—until <strong>Slumpet’s ball bearings</strong> landed a hit. True to his word, Manus handed over the crystal and vanished.</li>
<li>Back in the temple, attempts to restore the crystal failed. The <strong>Arbiter suggested</strong> it might be <strong>tainted</strong> or need a <strong>ritual</strong>.</li>
<li>Shad used <strong>Contact Other Plane</strong> to reach <strong>Maria</strong>, Alora’s mother:
<ul>
<li><strong>Party cannot fix the crystal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Summer Court lacks the means</strong></li>
<li><strong>Chained Library holds the answers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Winter Court knows nothing</strong></li>
<li><strong>The center of Elven territory may help</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-broken-loop-and-the-merchant-of-secrets">🔄 <em>The Broken Loop and the Merchant of Secrets</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>While returning to the Summer Court, the party entered a <strong>temporal loop</strong> in the forest:
<ul>
<li>Experienced <strong>repeating scenery</strong>, <strong>time distortions</strong>, and <strong>deja vu</strong></li>
<li>Noticed signs of the <strong>escaped basilisk</strong> from Kharvax’s failed ritual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discovered <strong>Blackbird</strong>, a <strong>raven-like eldritch merchant</strong> who trades in <strong>secrets and contracts</strong>.</li>
<li>Blackbird offered help <strong>in exchange for a magical contract</strong> with Toby:
<ul>
<li>For <strong>three nights</strong>, she must <strong>pay for everyone’s drinks</strong></li>
<li>Violation will result in <strong>psychic damage</strong></li>
<li>The contract manifests as an invisible bracelet Toby feels on her wrist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blackbird returned with a <strong>charm that played a metal tune</strong> (“take control”), which helped Toby <strong>navigate the loop</strong> and <strong>lead the party out safely</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-back-in-the-summer-court-reforging-summers-edge">⚔️ <em>Back in the Summer Court: Reforging Summer’s Edge</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>After escaping the forest loop, the party returned to the <strong>Summer Court</strong>, where they:
<ul>
<li>Fulfilled night 1 of <strong>Blackbird’s drink contract</strong> (98 drinks = 19gp)</li>
<li>Shad tried (and failed) to perform badly enough to clear the tavern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Met with <strong>Lady Sylvia</strong>, who:
<ul>
<li>Was surprised but not hostile about the party having <strong>Summer’s Edge</strong></li>
<li>Confirmed the sword <strong>chooses its wielder</strong></li>
<li>Directed them to <strong>Elara Sunforge</strong>, the realm’s top smith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elara was thrilled to help, but needed two components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Celestial Ore</strong> from the <strong>Starfall Crater</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>First Kiss of the Midday Sun</strong> from the <strong>Feywild</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-starfall-crater-and-the-celestial-guardian">🌠 <em>Starfall Crater and the Celestial Guardian</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Traveled north to a <strong>meteor crater</strong>, filled with glowing alien stone, swirling mist, and a song-like hum of cosmic energy.</li>
<li>Battled four <strong>Starfall Sentinels</strong> and a larger, intelligent <strong>Celestial Guardian</strong> wielding a blade of starlight.</li>
<li>After a hard-won victory, the <strong>pedestal cracked</strong>, revealing enough <strong>Celestial Ore</strong> to meet Elara’s needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-shopping-and-the-shimmering-glade">🛍️ <em>Shopping and the Shimmering Glade</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Returned to Elara with the ore; she confirmed it was suitable.</li>
<li>She found a nearby <strong>Fey crossing</strong>: the <strong>Shimmering Glade</strong></li>
<li>Shopped at the <strong>Glittering Cavern</strong>, where <strong>Toby purchased oddly specific items</strong> (moonstones, salt, bells, milk, etc.) in anticipation of Fey dealings.</li>
<li>Fulfilled <strong>night 2</strong> of Blackbird’s contract—more expensive this time, but manageable.</li>
<li>The next morning, ventured to the <strong>Shimmering Glade</strong>, a radiant clearing filled with latent magic and a ring of ancient standing stones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-squid-cats-and-the-crossing-to-the-feywild">🐾 <em>Squid Cats and the Crossing to the Feywild</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Found a <strong>six-legged “squid cat” mother</strong> (Displacer Beast) and her cubs in the center of the glade.</li>
<li>Attempted diplomacy instead of battle:
<ul>
<li><strong>Toby lured the cubs away with milk</strong></li>
<li><strong>Slumpet spotted a misaligned crystal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shad adjusted the crystal with a boost from Skreek</strong></li>
<li><strong>Skreek stunned the squid cat with leftover catnip</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the cubs safe and the threat avoided, the crystals activated and projected a <strong>portal to the Feywild</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toby dove in first</strong>, emerging in a vivid realm of riotous colors and surreal vegetation</li>
<li>As the rest of the party joined her, she turned and smirked:
<ul>
<li>“Welcome to the Feywild, kids…”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-welcome-to-the-feywild">🌈 <em>Welcome to the Feywild</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>The party crossed into the <strong>Feywild</strong> via the <strong>Shimmering Glade</strong>, finding themselves in a lush, colorful world of exaggerated flora and strange energy.</li>
<li>Skreek scouted from above and spotted a <strong>mountain to the northwest</strong>—a prime location to capture the <strong>First Kiss of the Midday Sun</strong>.</li>
<li>Journeyed to <strong>Medusa’s Wake</strong>, a lagoon-ruin believed to be the site of a battle between a <strong>medusa and a storm giant</strong>.</li>
<li>Discovered a <strong>festival of satyrs</strong> led by <strong>Revel Pipesong</strong>. Shad disguised himself and gave a musical performance with Skreek’s invisible help.</li>
<li>Party learned the trail up the mountain began at the satyr camp.</li>
<li>Engaged in a <strong>magical drinking game</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Skreek now <strong>speaks only in rhyme</strong> for 7 days</li>
<li>Toby bursts into <strong>inappropriate laughter</strong></li>
<li>Shad’s <strong>hair becomes flowering vines</strong> when lying or breaking promises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Declined Revel’s offer of “a single night of unbridled joy in exchange for a future favor”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-first-kiss-of-the-midday-sun">☀️ <em>The First Kiss of the Midday Sun</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Toby wakes up and realizes that Blackbird&rsquo;s contract bracelet is gone, which signals:
<ul>
<li>Time passes differently in the Feywild</li>
<li>The contract has been fulfilled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Began the <strong>ascent of the mountain</strong> the next morning with Elara’s capturing device in hand.</li>
<li>Encountered a <strong>moss-covered fey troll</strong> guarding a pass:
<ul>
<li>Each strike spawned <strong>animated flesh clones</strong></li>
<li>After a difficult battle, the party continued upward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the mountain peak, <strong>Skreek beheld a vision</strong> while holding the shards of <strong>Summer’s Edge</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A memory of the sword being gifted to a champion by the <strong>Queen of the Summer Court</strong></li>
<li>A battlefield vision disrupted by darkness and shattering fragments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the distance, the party saw a <strong>twisted black castle</strong>—gothic, shifting, and <em>watching</em>—which hadn’t been there a moment ago&hellip; or perhaps always had.</li>
<li>At a <strong>ceremonial altar</strong>, Slumpet placed Elara’s device to capture the sun’s essence.</li>
<li>As the sun’s light bathed the altar, <strong>Summer’s Edge began to stir</strong>, resonating with the light and Skreek’s presence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-duel-with-manus-again">🃏 <em>A Duel with Manus, Again</em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manus appeared</strong>, taunting the party:
<ul>
<li>“Drawing broken swords now, bird? I do hope you brought sharper company.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created <strong>magical darkness</strong> around Elara’s device and summoned <strong>two clones</strong> on the cliffs above.</li>
<li>Only Skreek could perceive within the darkness, thanks to his <strong>blindsight</strong>.</li>
<li>Shad dispelled the darkness, drawing mocking praise from Manus.</li>
<li>After several rounds of fighting, <strong>Manus called off the battle</strong>, vanishing with a final taunt and leaving the party winded but intact.</li>
<li>Elara’s device <strong>completed its capture</strong>—a soft, warm pulse confirmed that the <strong>First Kiss of the Midday Sun</strong> had been secured.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-forgotten-castle">🏰 <em>The Forgotten Castle</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>With both <strong>Celestial Ore</strong> and the <strong>Midday Sun’s essence</strong>, the party is now ready to <strong>reforge Summer’s Edge</strong>.</li>
<li>Unsure how to return from the Feywild, they decide to <strong>retrace their steps to the Shimmering Glade</strong>.</li>
<li>But before that, they’ve chosen to <strong>investigate the eerie gothic castle</strong> seen from the peak…
<ul>
<li>Though its presence is unsettling, it calls to them with <strong>irresistible gravity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party explored a <strong>mysterious Feywild castle</strong>, seemingly conjured into view. Its illusions shimmered between reality and unreality, and signs of enchantment were everywhere.</li>
<li>At the gates, they faced a <strong>riddle-speaking patchwork knight</strong>, passing its test to gain entry:
<ul>
<li>Love, the tongue, and humanity — each answer a key to the path ahead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inside, mirrors showed <strong>distorted visions of self</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Shad</strong> rejected a hollow legacy of applause and escaped harm thanks to Serenity’s necklace.</li>
<li><strong>Skreek</strong> accepted a vision of lonely heroism and gained a boon of luck.</li>
<li><strong>Slumpet</strong> rejected visions of betrayal and was psychically wounded.</li>
<li><strong>Toby</strong> embraced her monstrous reflection and earned a boon of luck.</li>
<li>A final glance from Toby hinted at a *<em>loom unraveling the fabric of the world</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-the-loom-chamber">🧵 <em>The Loom Chamber</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>A massive broken <strong>loom pulsed with dark illusion magic</strong>, clearly crafted by a master.</li>
<li>Shad disrupted the loom with thunderwave; Francis incinerated it at Shad’s request.</li>
<li>The room triggered hallucinations and memory loss — suggesting the <strong>loom once held influence over perception or identity</strong>.</li>
<li>Shad’s decision to destroy the loom marked a turning point: he accepted responsibility for unmaking something integral to the castle’s design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-the-echo-of-the-weaver">👁 <em>The Echo of the Weaver</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>throne room</strong>, the party met the <strong>Echo</strong>, a spectral remnant of the Weaver’s soul, bound to the castle.</li>
<li>The Echo recognized Shad as the one who destroyed the loom and demanded payment — a <strong>soul</strong> to rebuild it.</li>
<li>When the party refused, he summoned <strong>two wolves of shadow</strong> and attempted to extract Shad’s soul by force.
<ul>
<li>Shad survived the Echo’s powerful assaults thanks to uncanny luck and Serenity’s amulet.</li>
<li>Slumpet struck the decisive blow from the shadows, unraveling the Echo and banishing his summoned wolves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-revelations-in-the-weavers-study">📜 <em>Revelations in the Weaver’s Study</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Behind a hidden tapestry, the party found the <strong>Weaver’s study</strong> and journal.</li>
<li>The journal revealed:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>power of fear</strong> and illusion shaped the Weaver’s philosophy.</li>
<li>Illusions could be tied to <strong>triggers, emotions</strong>, and even bound to places and <strong>events</strong>.</li>
<li>The Weaver discovered and mastered <strong>Mirage Arcane</strong>, allowing him to <strong>reshape reality</strong> entirely.</li>
<li>His final entries describe a plan to <strong>weaken the leyline network</strong> and release <strong>Nidhogg</strong> by unraveling the threads anchoring the planes.</li>
<li>A <strong>spell that can tether his soul to paper</strong>, known as <strong>Silmirien</strong>, can <strong>call him home</strong> if a page is burned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slumpet also found a <strong>map of leyline energy</strong> and leyline temple locations, marked with several <strong>“Hollow Thresholds”</strong>—unexplained but likely significant to the cult’s portal activities. He <strong>kept this map secret</strong>, considering its potential value to his mysterious dwarven contacts.</li>

            <h1 id="central-tension"><strong>Central Tension</strong></h1>
<p>A tense stalemate exists between Elves, masters of magic and the planes, and Dwarves, experts of crafting and technology.  The nature vs technology worldviews of the Elves and Dwarves are at the heart of the lasting distrust and conflict.  Over the years, each side has tried pushing into each other&rsquo;s territory to gain natural resources or reclaim ancestral lands of cultural significance.</p>
<h2 id="elves">Elves</h2>
<h3 id="key-features">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nature: magic, elemental planes</li>
<li>Matriarchy</li>
<li>Artists: lore masters, painters, sculptors</li>
<li>Allied with: Tieflings, Aasimar, Gensai, Dragonborn (metallic)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elven control over magic is due to their proximity to a large rift between the mundane world and the elemental planes (Feywild and Shadowfell are closest)</li>
<li>A powerful magical barrier holds the elemental energies at bay (<em>Forbiddence</em>) and allows the elves to tap into the planes with some level of control.</li>
<li>The original Matriarch organized the ritual that created the barrier and lent much of her power to its formation.</li>
<li>Elves were forced to seek out magic power and items in the planes (city of brass, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secrets">Secrets</h3>
<ol>
<li>Few still live that can remember the details of the ritual well enough to sustain the barrier</li>
<li>No one has been born with the Matriarch&rsquo;s gift for barriers in two generations, and the barrier is beginning to weaken.</li>
<li>May need celestial assistance? (Arcadia v1)</li>
<li>A powerful entity from the Shadowfell seeks to take advantage of the weakening barrier to enter our world.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h2>
<h3 id="key-features-1">Key Features</h3>

<li>Allied with: Gnomes, Half-Orcs, Tritons, Dragonborn (chromatic)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="details-1">Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dwarves control a magical forge at the largest volcano in the realm</li>
<li>The Dwarves use some of the technology to hide some of their greatest technology and research centers. (think Wakanda)</li>
<li>One of the Dwarven “temples” might give off clouds of nanomachines that, when ingested, allow a person to control certain artifacts. They periodically have to go back to the temple to recharge the machines or ingest new ones.</li>
<li>Dwarves use cyphers (one-time use magic items) to aid them in the field</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secrets-1">Secrets</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dwarven technology is not their own but was discovered generations ago deep under the mountain by the Dwarven kingdom currently in power.</li>
<li>This is a technology of an ancient civilization long since extinct. (think Numenera).</li>
<li>The other Dwarves kingdoms learn of the lost technology and are searching for a new cache of tech from an even older civilization.</li>
<li>One of the Dwarven chief scientists is a disguised mind flayer trying to find technology to help it get back to its home plane/world.</li>
