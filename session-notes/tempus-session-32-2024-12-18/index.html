Below you lies a massive crater, its edges blackened and jagged as though the land itself was torn apart by some ancient cataclysm. Faint trails of shimmering, silvery mist rise from the crater’s depths, curling and twisting like restless spirits. The ground glows faintly with a soft, pulsing light, as if the earth still remembers the impact of something impossibly powerful.</p>
<p>Jagged shards of crystal, each glinting with the light of a thousand distant stars, are embedded in the walls of the crater. The faint hum of energy fills the air, resonating deep in your chest, and you can’t shake the feeling that you’re standing in the presence of something far greater than yourself—something ancient and alive.</p>
<p>In the center of the crater, a fractured pedestal of stone and crystal stands amidst a field of glowing, alien formations. A low, melodic vibration echoes through the area, like the song of the cosmos itself, beckoning you forward. The hair on the back of your neck rises. This place feels sacred, yet there’s an unsettling weight to it, as though you’ve stepped into a realm not meant for mortal feet.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Animated Starfall Shards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the party approaches, pieces of the ore begin to glow and break away, forming <strong>Starfall Sentinels</strong>—small but dangerous constructs of radiant energy and crystal.
<ul>
<li><strong>Enemies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>4 Starfall Sentinels</strong> <em>(Custom stat block based on “Earth Elementals” but dealing radiant damage instead of bludgeoning.)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Each Starfall Sentinel emits an <strong>Aura of Radiance</strong> (10 ft), forcing the party to make Constitution saves or suffer <strong>blindness</strong> for 1 round.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> <em>&ldquo;The ore shatters into fragments that rise into the air, hovering like crystalline guardians. Each shard pulses with blinding radiance, releasing waves of light as they close in on you.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2: The Celestial Guardian</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the sentinels are defeated, the pedestal begins to hum. The Celestial Ore is protected by a more powerful being—a <strong>Celestial Guardian</strong> that manifests to test the party’s worthiness.
<ul>
<li><strong>Enemy:</strong> <em>Guardian of the Shattered Star</em> (Use the <strong>Shield Guardian</strong> stat block but with radiant damage instead of force damage, and glowing celestial aesthetics).</li>
<li><strong>Special Ability:</strong> Once per round, the Guardian releases a <strong>Radiant Pulse</strong> (20 ft burst) that deals radiant damage and forces a DC 14 Dexterity save to avoid being knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Flavor:</strong> <em>&ldquo;A towering figure of crystalline light rises from the pedestal, its form radiant and formless—a silhouette of a knight forged from pure starlight. It raises a massive blade of glowing crystal and speaks in a voice like distant thunder: ‘Prove your worth, mortals, or be undone.’”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If the party defeats the guardian, the crystal pedestal cracks, revealing enough <strong>Celestial Ore</strong> to fulfill Elara&rsquo;s requirements. If they fail to defeat the guardian but survive, it may challenge them to “return when they are worthy.”</p>

          <td><strong>Feywild Bloom:</strong> The forest ahead shimmers as vibrant flowers and trees from the Feywild spontaneously sprout. A group of <strong>pixies</strong> are playing tricks, trying to lead the party astray. The party must either appease the pixies with a gift or pass a Charisma (Persuasion) check to be allowed safe passage. If angered, the pixies may cast confusing illusions.</td>

      <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td><strong>Shadowfall Tears:</strong> The air grows cold and the forest dims as a rift to the Shadowfell opens nearby. Emerging from the tear are <strong>2 shadow demons</strong> and <strong>3 wraiths</strong> hunting for life energy. These creatures pursue the party, aiming to drain their vitality. The party may choose to confront the creatures or flee, as closing the rift requires quick thinking or magical means.</td>

      <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td><strong>Unstable Magic:</strong> A wild magic surge ripples through the forest. The party stumbles upon an area where magic behaves unpredictably. Any spell cast within a 30-foot radius requires a roll on the <strong>Wild Magic Surge</strong> table (PHB p. 104). This zone is unstable, and creatures entering it must also make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) to resist temporary confusion.</td>

      <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td><strong>Elven Refugees:</strong> A group of elven refugees from the Summer Court is fleeing the forest’s instability. They carry valuable information about the cult’s movements and could offer aid in exchange for help reaching safety. However, they are being stalked by a <strong>shadow mastiff</strong> pack, and the party must either defeat the hounds or protect the elves while they escape.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td><strong>Rogue Fey Beasts:</strong> Fey creatures from the Feywild, such as <strong>2 eladrin archers</strong> and their trained <strong>dire elk</strong>, have become corrupted by leyline magic. These once noble beings now attack anything that moves, mistaking the party for intruders. They are hostile but could be reasoned with through a difficult Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>6</td>
          <td><strong>Blighted Grove:</strong> The trees in this part of the forest have withered and blackened, and a dark pool of stagnant water dominates the area. The party is confronted by a <strong>blight</strong> infestation (1 shambling mound, 2 vine blights, 3 twig blights). The shambling mound has been affected by the weakening leyline magic and possesses strange fey-like abilities, such as teleporting through the trees.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>7</td>
          <td><strong>Fey Court Messenger:</strong> A <strong>Summer Eladrin</strong> on horseback, sent by the Summer Court, approaches the party with a cryptic message: “The forest’s heart bleeds. Time grows short. Restore balance, or all shall be lost to shadow and fire.” The eladrin vanishes after delivering the message. This encounter may give the party insight into how to stabilize the leyline.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>8</td>
          <td><strong>Solar Elemental Surge:</strong> A surge of unstable magic awakens a <strong>fire elemental</strong> and <strong>2 radiant sprites</strong> near the Summer Court&rsquo;s leyline temple. The elemental has been corrupted and now burns uncontrollably, threatening to spread through the surrounding forest. The party can either contain the flames (via water spells or natural means) or engage in combat to quell the elemental’s fury.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td><strong>Haunted Ruins:</strong> The party discovers ancient elven ruins, now haunted by <strong>4 specters</strong> and <strong>1 banshee</strong>. These spirits were once temple guards, but the leyline damage has bound them to the ruins. They may attempt to communicate with the party if a ritual of peace is performed, offering clues about the leyline’s original purpose.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td><strong>Fey Ambush: Quicklings</strong> and <strong>darklings</strong> aligned with the Cult of the Eclipse ambush the party as they travel. These creatures attempt to steal the party’s valuables, particularly any magical items or leyline-related artifacts they carry. The quicklings use their speed to dart in and out of combat, while the darklings strike from the shadows.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>11</td>
          <td><strong>Sunfire Tree Guardians:</strong> A grove of ancient, golden trees begins to glow with intense light as <strong>2 awakened trees</strong> and <strong>4 dryads</strong> rise to protect the forest. They are suspicious of outsiders, believing the party may be the source of the forest’s instability. Through a Wisdom (Insight) check, the party can convince them of their good intentions or be forced to defend themselves.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>12</td>
          <td><strong>Cult Scout:</strong> The party encounters a <strong>lone scout from the Cult of the Eclipse</strong>, hiding in the trees and observing them from afar. The scout may attempt to lure the party into a trap or retreat to inform his superiors. If captured, the scout can be interrogated to reveal the cult’s next move in the forest. Alternatively, he could offer a bribe to be released.</td>

<ul>
<li>Went to the Ember’s Embrace to enjoy some drinks
<ul>
<li>Paid 19 gold for the 98 drinks ordered at the bar that night in order to satisfy the contract that Toby signed with Blackbird</li>
<li>Shad volunteered to perform at the bar and attempted to play poorly enough to scare away customers. His natural instincts and talent were too good and the best he could muster was average</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The next morning the party visited Sylvia at the Summer Court palace to fill her in on what they had discovered at the leyline temple. The party also asked her point them in the direction of a smith that could help them reforge Summer’s Edge. The party was pleasantly surprised that Sylvia was not angry about them having the sword. Sylvia told them that artifacts like Summer’s Edge had a mind of their own and wouldn’t let itself fall into the hands of someone unworthy.</li>
<li>Based on Sylvia’s advice, the party decided to visit the large blacksmith’s forge next to the Colleseum. There they met with Elara Sunforge, the most talented smith of the summer court.
<ul>
<li>Elara was thrilled at the prospect of reforging the sword, but informed the party they would need two rare materials: celestial ore and the first kiss of the midday sun from the feywild</li>
<li>Elara knew where to find the ore and directed the party to visit a crater where a meteor fell long ago.</li>
<li>Elara also had a device capable of capturing the kiss of the midday sun, but would need to help the party track down a favorable crossing to the feywild.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The party journeyed north to the crater to find the ore
<ul>
<li>at the crater, they found a natural pedestal in the center where it looked like some of the ore could be seen. When approach, 4 Starfall Sentinels appeared from the surrounding rock and attempted to defend the pedestal.</li>
<li>After the sentinels were defeated, a single large construct of starlight and crystal assembles before the party and tells them to leave this sacred place or prove their worth.</li>
</ul>
