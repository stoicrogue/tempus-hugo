Background: A charismatic performer and storyteller with a tragic past, Shadicar’s village was destroyed by a horrifying illusion conjured by the Weaver. Ever since, he&rsquo;s pursued knowledge and justice, weaving his sorrow into songs that inspire allies and unnerve enemies. He has formed a subtle rivalry (and perhaps infatuation) with Trius of the Winter Court and is often the party’s spokesperson and moral compass.

#<a href=/tags/tempus/>tempus</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content><div><h1 id=main-party>Main Party<a href=#main-party class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><h2 id=shadicar>Shadicar<a href=#shadicar class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Half-Elf Bard<br><strong>Background:</strong> A charismatic performer and storyteller with a tragic past, Shadicar’s village was destroyed by a horrifying illusion conjured by the Weaver. Ever since, he&rsquo;s pursued knowledge and justice, weaving his sorrow into songs that inspire allies and unnerve enemies. He has formed a subtle rivalry (and perhaps infatuation) with Trius of the Winter Court and is often the party’s spokesperson and moral compass. Recently gifted the <strong>Fochlucan Bandore</strong>, his bardic magic has grown even more formidable.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Silver tongue, emotionally intuitive, cunning gambler, carries the weight of personal loss.</p><h2 id=skreek>Skreek<a href=#skreek class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Aarakocra Paladin<br><strong>Background:</strong> A noble and devout warrior of the Dusk Lord, Skreek embodies steadfast duty and honor. He’s on a personal quest to recover a stolen relic tied to his faith and culture. His unwavering sense of justice led him to duel a spectral knight in an ancient leyline temple—and win. Skreek’s martial prowess and aerial advantage make him a fearsome combatant, while his healing touch saved Olivia, daughter of the Lady of Winter.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Skyborne strategist, religious devotion, Frostbrand-wielding duelist, shield-bearer of light.</p><h2 id=toby>Toby<a href=#toby class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Half-Elf Blood Hunter<br><strong>Background:</strong> A quiet and enigmatic figure, Toby walks the line between light and shadow. Trained to hunt monsters and empowered by forbidden rites, she does what must be done without complaint. Though she rarely speaks at length, her sharp observations often cut to the heart of the matter. She’s the one who reminds the group of the larger threat—the Cult of the Eclipse—and keeps them focused even when distractions abound. When tough calls are needed, she steps up, whether that means offering her own blood as tribute or striking a deal with a shady figure like Blackbird to further their cause.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Grounded realist, moral anchor, throws weapons that return via her <strong>Blinkback Belt</strong>, expert in occult threats.</p><h2 id=slumpet>Slumpet<a href=#slumpet class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Gnome Rogue<br><strong>Background:</strong> Clever, mischievous, and a bit impulsive, Slumpet has a knack for getting into—and out of—trouble. He’s bonded with fey creatures (notably Fannie the pixie), stolen from nobles, and even negotiated with a sarcastic flameskull named Francis. He carries Serenity’s cursed orb and is oddly protective of it despite its danger. He attempted to offer it to the leyline temple, which rejected it; only his gifted bow from the Winter Court proved acceptable. Though Slumpet plays the fool at times, his courage and cleverness are undeniable.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Fey-touched prankster, lockpicker extraordinaire, map thief, orb smuggler.<br><strong>Note on Summer’s Edge:</strong> While he’s invested in reforging the sword, it was <strong>Vidrir</strong>, not Slumpet, to whom Summer’s Edge seemed to respond—glowing faintly when the sage held it, as if it remembered him.</p><h1 id=allies>Allies<a href=#allies class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><h2 id=vidrir>Vidrir<a href=#vidrir class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Elven Druid / Sage of the Shimmerwood<br><strong>Background:</strong> A reclusive and ageless sage who resides in a protected grove deep within the Shimmerwood. Though he claims to be a simple friend of Lerissa, the truth slips through his stories—he is almost certainly a veteran of the great war against the undead and a former member of the Order of Seasons. His connection to Summer’s Edge is profound; when he held the broken sword, it stirred to life in his hands. Wise, calm, and fiercely protective of the balance of nature, Vidrir has become a trusted mentor to the party.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Guardian of secrets, possibly immortal, subtly powerful, enjoys tea and tales.</p><h2 id=lerissa>Lerissa<a href=#lerissa class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Tiefling / Retired Adventurer & Tavern Owner<br><strong>Background:</strong> Proprietor of the Raven’s Perch Tavern in Tannis, Lerissa is a retired adventurer who keeps her blades hung behind the bar and her secrets close. She guided the party in their early days, pointing them toward Vidrir, providing refuge in her windmill, and offering cryptic insights about the Order of Seasons. Though no longer active in the field, she remains a savvy operator with deep connections—and keeps her eyes and ears open for trouble.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Sharp wit, mysterious past, owns a wolf named Duchess, brews damn good ale.</p><h2 id=elara-sunforge>Elara Sunforge<a href=#elara-sunforge class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Eladrin / Master Smith of the Summer Court<br><strong>Background:</strong> Elara is the great smith of the Summer Court—renowned across the Fey realms for her craftsmanship. When the party brought her the broken pieces of Summer’s Edge, she recognized the blade immediately. While she agreed to help reforge it, she insisted that the party gather the necessary materials, including the <strong>First Kiss of the Midday Sun</strong> from the Feywild. Though regal and intense, Elara respects valor and integrity, and her work may be the key to restoring a symbol of hope.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Legendary smith, commands sun-forged magic, wise but exacting.</p><h2 id=alora-lady-of-winter>Alora, Lady of Winter<a href=#alora-lady-of-winter class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Eladrin / Queen of the Winter Court<br><strong>Background:</strong> Regal, composed, and deeply burdened, Alora is the current ruler of the Winter Court. She commands a powerful magical domain and watches over the leyline barriers that protect the realm from extraplanar intrusion. Her court has been increasingly under siege by strange occurrences as the leylines weaken. After the party saved her poisoned daughter, she pledged her trust and aid—rewarding the party with powerful magic items and arcane knowledge.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Dignified and strategic, matriarchal leader, bearer of ancient responsibility.</p><h2 id=trius>Trius<a href=#trius class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Eladrin / Paladin of the Winter Court<br><strong>Background:</strong> Alora’s eldest daughter and wielder of a legendary Moonblade, Trius embodies the Winter Court’s militant strength. She initially rebuffed the party’s quest, but joined them after recognizing the threat Serenity posed. In battle, she is a force of nature—deadly, inspiring, and unrelenting. Her bond with Shadicar has an edge of friendly rivalry and flirtation.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Wields a Moonblade, inspires musical battle hymns, fearless and proud.</p><h2 id=the-arbiter>The Arbiter<a href=#the-arbiter class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Angel of Justice / Servant of the Dusk Lord<br><strong>Background:</strong> A celestial being awakened beneath the temple in Tannis. She sought to purge the village after its desecration, but allowed the party a chance to prove their worth. Bound by divine law, her actions are rigid but fair. She marked the party as emissaries and destroyed the darkness corrupting Tannis once they uncovered its source.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Radiant and wrathful, bound by oath, respects faith and integrity.</p><h2 id=francis>Francis<a href=#francis class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Undead / Flameskull<br><strong>Background:</strong> Once a guardian in a forgotten cabin, Francis was “killed” by the party, then later reanimated and convinced to join them on their travels. Sarcastic, excitable, and very into using his eye lasers, Francis now serves as a weird but powerful ally. His undead nature makes him an outsider—but one that’s eager for stories and battles.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Floating skull, magical artillery, surprisingly loyal, &ldquo;just happy to be included.&rdquo;</p><h1 id=adversaries>Adversaries<a href=#adversaries class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><h2 id=serenity>Serenity<a href=#serenity class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Night Hag Illusionist / Servant of the Shadow<br><strong>Background:</strong> Once a beautiful singer in a humble tavern, Serenity’s true form is a monstrous night hag allied with the Weaver and the shadow dragon Nidhogg. She orchestrated the curse that shrouded Tannis in darkness, defiled a holy relic, and used the party’s movements to track them through a magical orb. Her charm and manipulation nearly hid her for good, but the party eventually exposed and slew her. Even in death, her venomous wit lingered.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Master of deception, cruel and calculating, connected to the Cult of the Eclipse, feared the party enough to confront them personally.</p><h2 id=the-weaver>The Weaver<a href=#the-weaver class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Unknown / Master of Illusion and Fear<br><strong>Background:</strong> A shadowy figure whose illusions are powerful enough to kill. The Weaver orchestrated the destruction of Shadicar’s village with a conjured dragon so terrifying it caused death through fear alone. He works with agents like Serenity and may be in communion with Nidhogg, the shadow dragon. His ancestral home lies hidden in the Feywild, where illusions and echoes of his past unravel. The full extent of his power remains unknown—but his cruelty and reach are undeniable.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Unseen manipulator, architect of dread, possibly ancient, commands illusions that bend reality.</p><h2 id=manus>Manus<a href=#manus class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Unknown / Cult Commander<br><strong>Background:</strong> A high-ranking figure in the Cult of the Eclipse, Manus cloaks himself in magical darkness and is able to make magical copies of himself. He is not fully aligned to the cult&rsquo;s goals. He seems more interested in testing his abilities against strong foes. He told the party the Weaver won&rsquo;t agree to fight him until the quest to free Nidhogg is complete. He sees the rise of Nidhogg as inevitable and seems to relish the chaos that the Cult brings.
<strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Shrouded in darkness, brutally direct, wields corrupted magic, dangerous frontline commander.</p><h1 id=other>Other<a href=#other class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h1><h2 id=blackbird>Blackbird<a href=#blackbird class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p><strong>Race/Class:</strong> Unknown / Dealbroker & Information Dealer<br><strong>Background:</strong> A mysterious figure operating on the edges of the known world—perhaps fey, perhaps something darker—Blackbird offers deals, not favors. Toby struck a bargain with them in a moment of need, hinting at the weight and risk such pacts carry. They speak in riddles and half-truths, often appearing when the party is desperate. Their allegiance is unknown, and their goals are never stated plainly.<br><strong>Notable Traits:</strong> Elusive, transactional, sinister charm, possibly connected to deeper forces at play.</p></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
