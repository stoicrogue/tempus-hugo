<p>After the basilisk dies, a creature can make a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check using an herbalism kit and the basilisk&rsquo;s gullet, destroying the gullet in the process. On a success, the creature creates three doses of a salve. One dose of this salve can be applied to a petrified creature as an action, and 1 minute after the salve is applied, the petrified condition ends for that creature.</p>

<h3 id="petrifying-eye-beams">Petrifying Eye Beams.<a href="#petrifying-eye-beams" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>The basilisk targets one or two creatures they can see within 30 feet of them. Each target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be restrained as they magically begin to turn to stone. Until the end of the restrained creature&rsquo;s next turn, they or an ally within 5 feet of them can use an action to cut the encroaching stone from the restrained creature&rsquo;s body using a weapon that deals slashing damage. When they do, the restrained creature takes 13 (2d12) slashing damage, which can&rsquo;t be reduced in any way, and they are no longer restrained.</p>
<p>A creature restrained in this way must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, this creature is petrified until freed by a cure ailment power of 4th order or higher, a greater restoration spell, or a similar supernatural effect.</p>
<h3 id="poison-fumes-recharge-46">Poison Fumes (Recharge 4–6).<a href="#poison-fumes-recharge-46" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>The basilisk exhales poisonous fumes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in this area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (4d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<h3 id="description-ideas">Description Ideas:<a href="#description-ideas" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Familiar Landmarks with Minor Changes:</strong><br>
As the party walks, describe a large, distinctive oak tree with twisting roots they pass. A little while later, describe a very similar oak tree, but with subtle differences—a slight shift in the way the roots wind or the moss growing on it in an unusual pattern.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Ahead, you see a massive oak tree, its roots curling over the path like tendrils. A faint, familiar feeling washes over you—perhaps you’ve passed a tree like this before. Or maybe this one?&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sound of Echoing Footsteps:</strong><br>
As they move forward, let them hear their own footsteps echo strangely, or the faint sound of their past footsteps repeating behind them.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Your boots crunch against the fallen leaves, but after a few moments, you hear a faint echo of footsteps—your own, perhaps, though it seems to come from behind you, where none should be.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Repetitive Wildlife:</strong><br>
Introduce an animal—like a brightly colored bird or a small fox—early on in the description of the forest. Then, as they continue walking, describe the same animal again in a slightly different position or behavior.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;A fox with a silver-tipped tail darts across the path and vanishes into the brush. A few minutes later, another fox—silver-tipped tail and all—appears, running in the same direction. The deja vu is palpable.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shifting Time of Day:</strong><br>
The sunlight through the trees might shift in an unusual pattern. At one moment, the sun may hang low in the sky as if it&rsquo;s evening, only for the light to shift back to bright midday after the party walks a few steps further.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;As you follow the winding path, the golden light of the setting sun filters through the trees. But as you continue, the sun seems to rise again, higher in the sky, casting long morning shadows. Something doesn’t feel right, but it&rsquo;s hard to say what.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Symbols or Runes:</strong><br>
Small, seemingly inconsequential markings (perhaps old fey runes, symbols of the seasons, or the Cult of the Eclipse) might appear on rocks or trees. After some time, the party notices the same runes reappearing, or they see the markings growing stronger as if urging them to realize the loop.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;You notice a faint marking on the bark of a tree—a spiral-like rune etched into the wood. The same rune, or one very much like it, appears again several minutes later, though it looks slightly deeper, almost glowing.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sudden Cold or Warmth:</strong><br>
The party might notice temperature changes that seem familiar, as if they experienced them earlier. The air might grow warm and then cold again in the same fashion, suggesting they are moving through the same space over and over.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;The air grows noticeably warmer as you continue, a pleasant breeze accompanying the temperature shift. But moments later, the warmth returns, as if you’ve stepped into the same patch of sunlight once more.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hints-without-revealing-the-loop">Hints without Revealing the Loop:<a href="#hints-without-revealing-the-loop" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<ul>
<li>You can drop subtle comments from NPCs or members of the party who may be more perceptive (like the rogue or ranger) about the strange feeling of retracing steps:
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;I could swear we’ve passed that boulder before… but then again, every rock here looks alike.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let the party make small marks on trees or the ground (if they choose) and then later realize that the marks seem to disappear or return to the same spot.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-the-tension">Build the Tension:<a href="#build-the-tension" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>If the party begins to suspect something is wrong, they may start trying different tactics to break the loop—like turning around, splitting up, or using spells to track their path. You can intensify the situation by making small changes each time they go through the loop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colors fading:</strong> Each time they loop, colors in the forest grow more muted or desaturated, as though reality itself is breaking down.
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;The vibrant greens and golds of the forest begin to dull, almost as if a shadow is being cast over the world itself.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Voices from Another Time:</strong> The party might begin to hear voices or whispers of their past selves, creating an eerie, unsettling atmosphere.</li>

<p>Eventually, they will need to discover how to break free—perhaps by recognizing a specific environmental change or performing an action that stops the magical effect (e.g., a specific phrase tied to the fey or a seasonal aspect of the forest, like touching a tree in a certain way or offering something of value to the forest spirits).</p>
<p>If they cannot figure it out on their own, small hints could come through investigation or magic (like Detect Magic or Arcana checks), revealing the leyline instability is warping time and space around them.</p>
<hr>
<p>These techniques allow you to build a sense of unease and mystery without directly telling the party they’re trapped in a loop. They’ll gradually piece things together through the repetition of familiar sights and sounds until they realize they must take action to break free.</p>

      <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td><strong>Feywild Bloom:</strong> The forest ahead shimmers as vibrant flowers and trees from the Feywild spontaneously sprout. A group of <strong>pixies</strong> are playing tricks, trying to lead the party astray. The party must either appease the pixies with a gift or pass a Charisma (Persuasion) check to be allowed safe passage. If angered, the pixies may cast confusing illusions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td><strong>Shadowfall Tears:</strong> The air grows cold and the forest dims as a rift to the Shadowfell opens nearby. Emerging from the tear are <strong>2 shadow demons</strong> and <strong>3 wraiths</strong> hunting for life energy. These creatures pursue the party, aiming to drain their vitality. The party may choose to confront the creatures or flee, as closing the rift requires quick thinking or magical means.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td><strong>Unstable Magic:</strong> A wild magic surge ripples through the forest. The party stumbles upon an area where magic behaves unpredictably. Any spell cast within a 30-foot radius requires a roll on the <strong>Wild Magic Surge</strong> table (PHB p. 104). This zone is unstable, and creatures entering it must also make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) to resist temporary confusion.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td><strong>Elven Refugees:</strong> A group of elven refugees from the Summer Court is fleeing the forest’s instability. They carry valuable information about the cult’s movements and could offer aid in exchange for help reaching safety. However, they are being stalked by a <strong>shadow mastiff</strong> pack, and the party must either defeat the hounds or protect the elves while they escape.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td><strong>Rogue Fey Beasts:</strong> Fey creatures from the Feywild, such as <strong>2 eladrin archers</strong> and their trained <strong>dire elk</strong>, have become corrupted by leyline magic. These once noble beings now attack anything that moves, mistaking the party for intruders. They are hostile but could be reasoned with through a difficult Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>6</td>
          <td><strong>Blighted Grove:</strong> The trees in this part of the forest have withered and blackened, and a dark pool of stagnant water dominates the area. The party is confronted by a <strong>blight</strong> infestation (1 shambling mound, 2 vine blights, 3 twig blights). The shambling mound has been affected by the weakening leyline magic and possesses strange fey-like abilities, such as teleporting through the trees.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>7</td>
          <td><strong>Fey Court Messenger:</strong> A <strong>Summer Eladrin</strong> on horseback, sent by the Summer Court, approaches the party with a cryptic message: “The forest’s heart bleeds. Time grows short. Restore balance, or all shall be lost to shadow and fire.” The eladrin vanishes after delivering the message. This encounter may give the party insight into how to stabilize the leyline.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>8</td>
          <td><strong>Solar Elemental Surge:</strong> A surge of unstable magic awakens a <strong>fire elemental</strong> and <strong>2 radiant sprites</strong> near the Summer Court&rsquo;s leyline temple. The elemental has been corrupted and now burns uncontrollably, threatening to spread through the surrounding forest. The party can either contain the flames (via water spells or natural means) or engage in combat to quell the elemental’s fury.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td><strong>Haunted Ruins:</strong> The party discovers ancient elven ruins, now haunted by <strong>4 specters</strong> and <strong>1 banshee</strong>. These spirits were once temple guards, but the leyline damage has bound them to the ruins. They may attempt to communicate with the party if a ritual of peace is performed, offering clues about the leyline’s original purpose.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td><strong>Fey Ambush: Quicklings</strong> and <strong>darklings</strong> aligned with the Cult of the Eclipse ambush the party as they travel. These creatures attempt to steal the party’s valuables, particularly any magical items or leyline-related artifacts they carry. The quicklings use their speed to dart in and out of combat, while the darklings strike from the shadows.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>11</td>
          <td><strong>Sunfire Tree Guardians:</strong> A grove of ancient, golden trees begins to glow with intense light as <strong>2 awakened trees</strong> and <strong>4 dryads</strong> rise to protect the forest. They are suspicious of outsiders, believing the party may be the source of the forest’s instability. Through a Wisdom (Insight) check, the party can convince them of their good intentions or be forced to defend themselves.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>12</td>
          <td><strong>Cult Scout:</strong> The party encounters a <strong>lone scout from the Cult of the Eclipse</strong>, hiding in the trees and observing them from afar. The scout may attempt to lure the party into a trap or retreat to inform his superiors. If captured, the scout can be interrogated to reveal the cult’s next move in the forest. Alternatively, he could offer a bribe to be released.</td>
