&lt;em>“As long as Summer’s Edge shines, the night shall never truly fall.”&lt;/em>&lt;br>
&lt;em>— Inscription on the sword’s original scabbard&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Forged in ages past by the smiths of the Summer Court, Summer’s Edge was once the blade of Sir Eirik, Champion of the Summer Court and Captain of the Order of Seasons.

Why rely on an audience’s gaze? Why perform for them when I can weave cause and effect into the very fabric of a place? I have found a method to bind illusions to events — a sound, a footstep, a heartbeat. They spring to life when I command them, like faithful servants awaiting their cue. I call it a &amp;ldquo;programmed illusion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
