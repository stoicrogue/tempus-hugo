<p>[!quote] First Sparks
Today, I cast an illusion no one could see through.  Father called it child&rsquo;s play — a trick for fairs and fools. But when I showed him the wolf at the window and watched the blood drain from his face, I knew: there is power in belief.</p>
<p>Even without substance, fear is real.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] The Dance of Triggers
Why rely on an audience’s gaze? Why perform for them when I can weave cause and effect into the very fabric of a place?  I have found a method to bind illusions to events — a sound, a footstep, a heartbeat. They spring to life when I command them, like faithful servants awaiting their cue. I call it a &ldquo;programmed illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thrill of setting a trap no blade can cut&hellip; intoxicating.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] Living Echoes
The illusions can be more than simple images. I shape their movements, their words, their reactions.  I build performances so convincing that even I forget they are false until I will them gone.  Emotion deepens the weave. Anger strengthens it. Fear makes it linger.</p>
<p>The house listens. The house remembers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] Beyond the Curtain
I glimpsed it today — a vast tapestry, not of image but of reality itself. A landscape reshaped, a castle dissolved and rebuilt in the span of a breath.  The spell is called Mirage Arcane.  It requires not only will but dominion over truth and lie alike.</p>
<p>When I master this, my enemies will not simply see what is false—they will <strong>live</strong> in it, until they forget what was ever real.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] The Last Thread
There is no truth but what I weave. Their minds, their senses, their hearts — all are threads for my loom.  Let them come. Let them wander halls of sorrow, fields of ash, towers built on screams.</p>
<p>In this place, even hope is but an illusion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] Fate-touched Paper
<em>Silmirien</em> — I have named it thus, a tether of light woven through ink and intention.</p>
<p>Should this book ever slip from my hands—or worse, from my mind—it will call to me. Not loudly. Not always clearly. But surely, like dawn through mist.</p>
<p>The spell is delicate. It requires a piece of the whole—no mere duplicate, but a splinter drawn from the pages themselves, thinned with care and treated with moon-milk and shadowroot. Then, it is bound with a name I no longer speak.</p>
<p>A name written in invisible ink. A name that sleeps… until the light of a true moon wakes it.</p>
<p>I carry the tether with me always—stitched into my sleeve, close to my skin, where I can feel it thrum with my heartbeat.  As long as I live, it will guide me back to this book.  But if I am lost… burn the page. Its smoke will find me. Its flame will call me home.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] The First Thread Pulled
The Courts are blind in their rituals. They tend the barrier like farmers tending a crumbling dam — repairing cracks without ever questioning why the waters rise.</p>
<p>The leyline anchors&hellip; they are not invincible. They are <strong>woven constructs</strong>, made by mortal hands long ago, when fear drove them to bind the world in false light. I have walked the temples. I have touched the crystals. I have seen the strands of magic binding them to this plane. Weaken one, and the others strain. Break one, and the whole weave begins to unravel.</p>
<p>The Elders would call it heresy. Treason. Madness.  They would be wrong.</p>
<p>In the unraveling, truth waits. In the loosening of bonds, Nidhogg stirs. The path is clear. I need only find the correct threads to pull.</p>
<p>When the time is right, I shall leave this hollow house behind. My true work must be done elsewhere — far from prying eyes, where the new weave can begin.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>[!tip] If His True Name is Revealed and Spoken
Under the moonlight, the ink on the page shimmers and reveals a name that almost sings itself into the night air—soft, melodic, but <em>unmistakably elven</em>. When spoken aloud, something in the room tightens. The journal snaps closed. All light dims for a breath.</p>
<p>Then, every remaining page flutters, and from their shifting surfaces, a <strong>voice</strong>—his voice—emerges. Calm. Hollow. Prepared.</p>
<p>“If you’ve come this far, then you already know too much. Or perhaps… you know enough. Enough to stop me. Or to join me.”</p>
<p>A final illusion takes form. Not a memory this time, but a <em>message</em>. A standing echo of the Weaver, still masked, but weary.</p>
<p>He explains just enough: his location is hidden behind a veiled fold in the Feywild, reachable only when three conditions are met—something like “a thread severed, a name spoken, and a light uncast.” These become the party’s next puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Optional twist:</strong> As the name is spoken, the Silmirien page <em>regrows itself</em> from the ashes, forming anew, and now points unwaveringly in a specific direction. The tether is reformed—but now <em>the party holds the other end.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!tip] True Name
The name is elvish and beautiful—perhaps <em>Aelthirion</em>. Or <em>Valesarin</em>. Or a soft syllabled secret that carries melancholy in its phonemes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[!info] Silmirien
<strong>Silmirien</strong> – &ldquo;silmi&rdquo; (gleam/light) + &ldquo;rien&rdquo; (woven) — <em>a woven gleam or tether of memory</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The page bound with his <strong>true name</strong> is subtly different—thicker, slightly glossy, odorless.</li>
<li>It radiates faint warmth when held at night.</li>
<li>The name is written in ink made of <strong>moon-milk and shadowroot</strong>—visible only under moonlight.</li>
<li>The name is elvish and beautiful—perhaps <em>Aelthirion</em>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
