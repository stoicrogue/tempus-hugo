# The Glamour Fades

> As Vidrir takes the reforged blade in his hands, the glade quiets. Light blooms from the blade. It reaches out with gentle insistence, like morning sun breaking mist.
> 
> Slowly, the air around Vidrir shimmers. His beard lengthens. His frame grows leaner and older, not frail—but timeless. His robes take on an archaic but elegant style. A single eye glimmers with ancient wisdom; the other is gone, covered by a simple eye patch.
> 
> Vidrir exhales, steady. “I suppose it’s time,” he says with quiet reverence. “Falsehood, even without malice, cannot stand in the light of Summer's Edge”.  The old sage smiles warmly as he gentle runs his finger along the back of the blade.  Still smiling but shaking his head, “No, there's nothing to forgive, bright one. I know it's just your nature. It does me well see you again.  …and in these chaotic times, we could use your strength and unwavering virtue.”
> 
> Vidrir turned back to the party and reverently handed the radiant blade back to Skreek. “Thank you for this opportunity to see my dear friend once more.  I'm sure you have questions”. He spread his hands and waited, as patient and calm as a mountain.

# Odin Implications 

**The Power Issue**: Instead of "he's recovering," consider: "His divine power is _actively holding_ the seal. He literally can't leave or take direct action without the seal collapsing. He's essentially chained himself to this plane as the final failsafe."

**Why Stay Disguised**: "Drawing divine attention to this realm—friend or foe—would escalate matters beyond mortal capacity to resolve. This must be a mortal victory, or it won't hold."

**The Long Timeline**: He's not recovering—he's _stuck_. He's been maintaining the seal personally for centuries. The only way he goes home is if the party either:

- Strengthens the barrier enough that he can withdraw his power safely
- Defeats Nidhogg permanently (freeing the power he invested)

# Vidrir/Odin Reveal - FAQ for DM

## **IDENTITY & NATURE**

### **"Are you really Odin? Like, THE Odin?"** 

> "I am known by many names across many realms. Odin, the All-Father, is one. Vidrir—the Weatherer, the Wide-Ruler—is another. In this place, in this time, Vidrir suited my purpose. But yes, I am he whom you know from the old tales."

### **"Why didn't you tell us before?"** 

> "Would you have spoken freely with a god? Would you have grown into the heroes you've become if you thought divine power would solve your problems? You needed to find your own strength. Besides, announcing oneself tends to... complicate matters."

### **"Is everything you told us a lie?"** 

> "I never lied about what mattered. My friendship with Lerissa is real. My knowledge of Summer's Edge is genuine. My concern for this realm is true. I simply... omitted certain details about who I was before I became the sage in the grove. The best disguises are built on truth."

### **"Do you still have your godly powers?"** 

> "Not in full. Much of my divine strength is... elsewhere. Occupied. I retain knowledge, wisdom, and some measure of power, but I am far from what I once was. In many ways, I am closer to you than to what I was."

## **THE SEAL & NIDHOGG**

### **"What exactly did you do to seal Nidhogg?"** 

> "When the Order of Seasons could not destroy him, I made a choice. I wove a portion of my divine essence into the barrier the elves constructed—an anchor point, a lock that only godly power could forge. The elven magic provides the cage; my power ensures the door remains shut."

### **"If you're so powerful, why didn't you just kill Nidhogg?"** 

> "Shadow dragons are not so easily unmade, even by gods. Nidhogg is ancient, cunning, and was at the height of his power. The Order fell before him. I could wound him, bind him, seal him away—but destroying him utterly would have required power I could not spare without abandoning other duties. So I chose imprisonment over annihilation."

### **"Is your power still holding the seal right now?"** 

> "Yes. Every moment. It's like... holding a door shut while something pounds against it from the other side. As the elven barrier weakens, more weight falls on my shoulders. I cannot leave, cannot fully restore myself, cannot even reveal my true form without risking everything. The disguise itself conserves power."

### **"What happens if the seal breaks?"** 

> "Two things. First, Nidhogg escapes—and this time he has allies, a cult, and centuries of rage fueling him. Second, the power I invested in the seal... I don't know if I'd get it back or if it would be lost with the breaking. I could be stranded here, diminished, possibly forever."

### **"So you're trapped here?"** 

> "In a sense. I am the final failsafe. If I leave, the seal collapses immediately. If I pull my power back to recover, Nidhogg walks free. I chose this burden willingly, but yes—I am bound here until this is resolved."

## **WHY HE NEEDS THE PARTY**

### **"If you're Odin, why do you need us? Can't you just fix this?"** 

> "If I could, I would have done so centuries ago. But there are rules—cosmic balances that even gods must respect. Direct divine intervention invites divine response. I draw the attention of powers that would make the Weaver look like a hedge wizard. This must be a mortal victory, won with mortal hands, or it will not hold."

### **"What can we do that you can't?"** 

> "You can act freely. You can repair the barrier—I cannot, for my power is already woven into it. You can hunt the Weaver and dismantle his cult—I cannot leave my post. You can rally the Courts and unite them—my presence would overshadow their agency. You are not constrained as I am. That makes you more powerful than you know."

### **"Are we your pawns? Have you been manipulating us?"** 

> "Have I guided you? Yes. Have I hoped you would grow strong enough to face what's coming? Absolutely. But manipulation implies I forced your choices. Every step of your journey has been yours. I simply... pointed you toward the path. You're the ones who walked it."

### **"What happens to you if we succeed?"** 

> "If you strengthen the barrier sufficiently, I can withdraw my power and finally go home. If you destroy Nidhogg entirely, the seal becomes unnecessary and I am freed. Either way, your success is my liberation. Our fates are bound together now."

## **THE ORDER OF SEASONS**

### **"Were you really part of the Order of Seasons?"** 

> "I founded it. When Nidhogg's undead legions threatened to drown the Feywild in shadow, I came to the Courts and proposed an alliance—one champion from each season, united in purpose. They trusted me then. I led them into battle. Most of them died buying time for the seal to be completed."

### **"Is your Order medallion real?"** 

> "Every word I spoke about it was true. I earned that medallion. I wore it in battle. I passed it to you because you've taken up the burden the Order once carried. You are the new champions, whether you bear the title or not."

### **"Why didn't the Order defeat Nidhogg permanently?"** 

> "We tried. We failed. He was too strong, and we were too few. But we hurt him—wounded him enough that binding became possible. The Order gave everything so that I could forge the seal. Their sacrifice bought this realm centuries of peace. Don't let it be for nothing."

## **SUMMER'S EDGE & THE REVEAL**

### **"Why did Summer's Edge reveal you?"** 

> "The blade was forged in truth and light. It cannot abide deception, even benign disguise. When it returned to its true form—whole and radiant—it saw through my veil as easily as dawn burns through mist. The sword simply did what it was made to do: illuminate what is hidden."

### **"Did you know this would happen?"** 

> "I suspected. But I had to see the blade whole again, to know it could be restored. That hope was worth the risk of revelation. Besides... perhaps it's time you knew the truth. The endgame approaches. You deserve to face it with clear eyes."

### **"Have you held Summer's Edge before?"** 

> "Yes. Its first wielder was my friend and my student. I was there when it was forged, there when it shattered, and I've mourned its loss ever since. Seeing it whole again... that's a gift I didn't think I'd receive."

## **THE DISGUISE & SUBTERFUGE**

### **"Who else knows who you really are?"** 

> "Fewer than you might think. Lerissa suspects, I believe, though we've never spoken of it directly. Alora may have pieced it together—she's ancient and wise. But most believe Vidrir is simply a talented druid who survived the old war. I've worked hard to maintain that illusion."

### **"Why this form? Why 'Vidrir'?"** 

> "I've walked the mortal realms in many guises. Vidrir felt... appropriate. A wanderer. A seeker of knowledge. Someone who could be helpful without being threatening. And the name itself is one of mine—a truth hiding in plain sight for those who knew to look."

### **"Does the Weaver know who you are?"** 

> "I don't believe so. If he did, his tactics would be different. He'd either avoid me entirely or commit everything to destroying me while I'm weakened. No, I think I'm just another obstacle to him—an old druid who knows too much."

### **"Could Nidhogg sense you?"** 

> "Perhaps. The power holding him bears my essence. He may recognize my touch in the seal, but knowing I'm here and finding me are different things. The Shadowfell and the mortal realm are separated by more than distance. He can't reach through the barrier... yet."

## **WHAT HAPPENS NOW**

### **"What should we do differently now that we know?"** 

"Nothing. Keep doing what you've been doing. Repair the barrier. Hunt the Weaver. Close the Hollow Thresholds. Unite the Courts. The mission hasn't changed—you simply understand the stakes better now."

### **"Will you help us more directly now?"** 

> "In the ways I can. Advice, knowledge, perhaps a small blessing or two. But I cannot leave this grove for long, and I cannot fight your battles for you. My power is committed elsewhere. You remain the tip of the spear."

### **"Can we tell others who you are?"** 

> "Use your judgment. The Courts may find it reassuring... or terrifying. Some mortals react poorly to knowing gods walk among them. But I won't forbid it. You've earned the right to speak truth, just as Summer's Edge did."

### **"What do you need from us?"** 

> "Do what you've been doing. Be brave. Be clever. Trust each other. Save this realm, and in doing so, set us both free. That's all I've ever needed from you—to be the heroes this age requires."

## **PERSONAL/PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS**

### **"Do you actually care about us, or are we just tools?"** 

> "I am a god, yes. But I am also a father who has lost children. A king who has watched kingdoms fall. A wanderer who has known friendship and loss. When I offered you tea, shared stories, laughed at your jokes—those were not performances. You matter to me. Your success would free me, yes, but your deaths would grieve me. Both can be true."

### **"What's it like being a god stuck in mortal form?"** 

> "Frustrating. Humbling. Occasionally enlightening. I've walked among mortals for eons, but rarely so... limited. It's taught me patience I didn't know I lacked. And reminded me why I do this work at all—because places like this, people like you, are worth preserving."

### **"Why do you care about our realm specifically?"** 

> "Because I helped build it. Because the Order bled for it. Because if Nidhogg escapes, he won't stop here—he'll spread like a plague to other realms, other worlds. And because... sometimes the stakes don't matter. Sometimes you protect something simply because it deserves to exist."

## **IF THEY GET HOSTILE/SUSPICIOUS**

### **"How do we know you're telling the truth NOW?"** 

> "You don't. You never did. But Summer's Edge believes me—it still burns bright in my presence. Your instincts have guided you this far—trust them now. Ask yourself: does the story fit? Does it explain what you've seen? And most importantly: does it change what you must do?"

### **"What if we don't want a god's help?"** 

> "Then don't think of me as one. Think of me as the old man who helped you when you needed it. The friend who pointed you toward your destiny. Call me Vidrir, and let Odin remain a distant myth. I'll answer to both."


## **GENERAL TONE NOTE**: 

Keep Vidrir warm but weary. He's relieved the secret is out, grateful for their help, but carrying centuries of burden. He should feel wise without being condescending, powerful without being frightening, and genuinely invested in their success beyond just his own liberation.
