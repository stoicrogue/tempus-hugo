🌿 Suggested Moment: “The Glamour Fades”

> As Vidrir takes the reforged blade in his hands, the chamber quiets. Light blooms from the blade. It reaches out with gentle insistence, like morning sun breaking mist.

Slowly, the air around Vidrir shimmers. His beard lengthens. His frame grows leaner and older, not frail—but timeless. His robes take on the style of a knight long fallen to legend, faded but intact. A single eye glimmers with radiant memory; the other is gone, a silent price paid long ago.

Shad recognizes the silhouette from Skreek’s mountaintop vision. Slumpet stiffens. Even Francis is silent.

Vidrir exhales, steady. “I suppose it’s time,” he says with quiet reverence. “The blade remembers me. And now… you remember me too.”

Summer’s Edge, for the first time, pulses with warmth in Skreek’s grip—as if affirming the truth.
