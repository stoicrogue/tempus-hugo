**Race/Class:** Unknown / Dealbroker & Information Dealer  

**Background:** A mysterious figure operating on the edges of the known world—perhaps fey, perhaps something darker—Blackbird offers deals, not favors. Toby struck a bargain with them in a moment of need, hinting at the weight and risk such pacts carry. They speak in riddles and half-truths, often appearing when the party is desperate. Their allegiance is unknown, and their goals are never stated plainly.  

**Notable Traits:** Elusive, transactional, sinister charm, possibly connected to deeper forces at play.
