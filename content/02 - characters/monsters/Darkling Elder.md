_**Death Burn.**_ When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded.

### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The darkling elder makes two Scimitar attacks.  
_**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.  
_**Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ The darkling elder casts darkness, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.
