**Race/Class:** Gnome Rogue  

**Background:** Clever, mischievous, and a bit impulsive, Slumpet has a knack for getting into—and out of—trouble. He’s bonded with fey creatures (notably Fannie the pixie), stolen from nobles, and even negotiated with a sarcastic flameskull named Francis. He carries Serenity’s cursed orb and is oddly protective of it despite its danger. He attempted to offer it to the leyline temple, which rejected it; only his gifted bow from the Winter Court proved acceptable. Though Slumpet plays the fool at times, his courage and cleverness are undeniable.  

**Notable Traits:** Fey-touched prankster, lockpicker extraordinaire, map thief, orb smuggler.  
**Note on Summer’s Edge:** While he’s invested in reforging the sword, it was **Vidrir**, not Slumpet, to whom Summer’s Edge seemed to respond—glowing faintly when the sage held it, as if it remembered him.
