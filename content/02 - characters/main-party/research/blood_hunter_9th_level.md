## Core Class Features

### Hunter's Bane (1st Level)
Beginning at 1st level, you have survived the imbibing of the Hunter's Bane, a poisonous alchemical concoction that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to the darkness and honing your senses against it.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, Fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time.

### Crimson Rite (1st Level)
At 1st level, you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this selection once made.

As a bonus action, you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite until your next short or long rest. While active, attacks made with this weapon deal an additional **1d6** rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon throws no direct radiance after the attack is complete.

When a crimson rite is activated, you suffer damage equal to your character level, and you reduce your maximum hit points by an amount equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoration of maximum hit points.

Crimson Rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time on your turn (no action required).

You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.

**At 9th level, you know 2 Primal Rites.**

**Primal Rites**
Choose from the following:
- **Rite of the Flame.** Your rite damage is fire type.
- **Rite of the Frozen.** Your rite damage is cold type.
- **Rite of the Storm.** Your rite damage is lightning type.

### Fighting Style (2nd Level) - Archery
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

**Archery**
You gain a **+2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons**.

### Blood Maledict (2nd Level)
At 2nd level, you gain the knowledge to further channel, and sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate your enemies. You gain one blood curse of your choice, detailed in the "blood curses" section below. You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 5th, 9th, 13th, 16th, and 20th level.

When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you may choose to amplify the curse by suffering damage equal to a roll of your crimson rite damage die. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse's description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses (DM's discretion).

You can use this feature **3 times between rests**, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

**At 9th level, you know 3 blood curses of your choice.**

### Blood Hunter Order (3rd Level)
At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose **Order of the Profane Soul**. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement (4th, 8th Level)
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Alternatively, you can choose a feat (if your DM allows the use of feats).

### Extra Attack (5th Level)
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Grim Psychometry (9th Level)
When you reach 9th level, you can take 10 minutes to meditate on an object to discern vague details regarding any lingering evil or wicked past surrounding it. Make a Wisdom ability check. Based on the result, the DM may reveal obscure information about dark events that may have previously surrounded the object, or hints toward a sinister purpose. This feature has no effect on objects untouched by evil. An object can only be targeted by this feature once, and future attempts reveal no further details.

You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Order of the Profane Soul Features

### Otherworldly Patron (3rd Level)
At 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an other-worldly being of your choice. **Your patron is the Archfey.**

### Pact Magic (3rd Level)
When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells.

**Cantrips:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.

**At 9th level, you know 2 cantrips.**

**Spell Slots:** The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

**At 9th level, you have 2 spell slots of 2nd level.**

**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:** At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

**At 9th level, you know 5 spells.**

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Rite Focus (3rd Level)
Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While you have an active rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your spells. Your chosen pact also enhances your rite.

**The Archfey:** You can cast **faerie fire** once using a profane soul spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Mystic Frenzy (7th Level)
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

## Archfey Expanded Spell List
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you:

**1st Level:** Faerie Fire, Sleep
**2nd Level:** Calm Emotions, Misty Step, Phantasmal Force  
**3rd Level:** Blink, Plant Growth
**4th Level:** Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility
**5th Level:** Dominate Person, Seeming

## Blood Curses Available
Choose **3 blood curses** from the following options:

### Blood Curse of Binding
As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind an enemy no more than one size larger than you within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or have their speed be reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.

**Amplify:** This curse becomes ongoing, and can affect a creature regardless of their size category. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.

### Blood Curse of the Eyeless
When an enemy who is not immune to blindness within 60 feet makes a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Amplify:** Following the triggering attack, the affected enemy has disadvantage on the next attack roll they make.

### Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet
The moment a creature falls unconscious or dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range. After the attack, the creature returns to being unconscious or dead.

**Amplify:** You grant a bonus to the attack roll and damage roll of the cursed creature's attack equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

### Blood Curse of the Fending Rite
When an enemy casts a spell that requires a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to deflect the spell with your crimson rite. You gain a bonus to the initial saving throw against that spell equal to your Wisdom Modifier (minimum of 1). This curse is invoked before the saving throw is rolled.

**Amplify:** You grant all allies within 5 feet of you this bonus to their saving throw against the triggering spell as well.

### Blood Curse of the Marked
As a bonus action, you can mark an enemy within 60 feet. Until the end of your turn, all crimson rite damage you deal to the target is doubled.

**Amplify:** You cause the marked target to also lose resistance to your rite damage type until the beginning of your next turn.

### Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering
As a bonus action, you can link to a creature within 30 feet for up to a minute, forcing them to share in the pain you inflict upon you. The next time the cursed creature damages you with a weapon attack, this curse deals necrotic damage to the cursed creature equal to half of the damage you suffered. This curse then ends.

**Amplify:** This curse instead deals damage equal to the damage you suffered, and it ignores Necrotic resistance.

### Blood Curse of Purgation
As a bonus action, you can manipulate the vitality of a creature within 60 feet to expunge a corruption in their blood. The target creature can immediately make a saving throw against a *poisoned* condition afflicting it.

**Amplify:** Your target can instead immediately make a saving throw against one other condition afflicting it. This condition can be *blinded, deafened,* or *paralyzed*.

### Blood Curse of the Spell Snare
When an enemy casts a spell within 60 feet that requires a spell attack roll and targets you, you can use your reaction to rend the spell from the air and impose disadvantage on the spell attack roll.

**Amplify:** You make a Wisdom ability check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell misses you automatically.
