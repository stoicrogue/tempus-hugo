Various ways of looking back at what happened in the campaign:

- **Session Notes** -- Raw notes captured during play, transferred from my handwritten notes back into Obsidian after each session.
- **Campaign Recap** -- A cleaned-up summary of those raw notes, ready to share with the players.
- **Campaign Dramatization** -- A prose retelling of the campaign's events. Throughout our three-year run, I shared updated sections with the players to help everyone remember where we'd been.
- **Quest Log** -- A running list of active, completed, and abandoned quests.
- **Timeline** -- Key events in chronological order.
- **Setting Overview** -- The world-building foundations of Tempus.
- **Session Prep Evolution** -- An analysis of how my DM prep style changed over 45+ sessions.
