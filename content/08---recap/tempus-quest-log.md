## 🏁 CAMPAIGN CONCLUSION

### ⚔️ The Final Battle — Gates of Season's End

**Location:** Ancient Battlefield (site of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s original sealing)
**Day 44**

The party arrived under a moonless sky to find the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s ritual already underway. A fifteen-foot portal pulsed at the base of the northern ruins, its edges etched with the same runes that once sealed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg). [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) waited near the portal and welcomed the party with arrows.

- [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s *Dawn* exposed the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s position through his greater invisibility; [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) drove Summer's Edge home with a Shining Smite
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) cast *Maze* on [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek), tearing him from the battlefield; the ritual advanced and the portal expanded
- [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) thundered in on her unicorn, Moonblade bared, spreading a silent battle hymn through all allies
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) dropped [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) unconscious; the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) intervened to revive him: _"You are still needed here, my champion."_
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) turned on the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) in fury as the battle escalated beyond what he'd agreed to
- [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) raised her Moonblade skyward — a pillar of silver moonlight tore down and struck the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) with devastating precision. His body crumpled. The ritual died with him.
- **[Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) did not walk free that night.**

### 🐉 Nidhogg — Remains Sealed

The summoning ritual failed. The Shadowfell prison holds. With the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) dead and the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) leaderless, the immediate threat to the barrier has passed — though the barrier itself remains damaged and in need of repair.

### 🕸️ The Weaver — Dead

Killed by [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)'s Moonbeam at the ancient battlefield. His Feywild Echo was also destroyed earlier — [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) struck the killing blow in the castle's throne room. The [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) has lost its architect.

### ⚖️ Manus — At Large

Turned on the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) during the final battle in fury when the ritual escalated beyond what he had agreed to. Did not pursue the party afterward. Current whereabouts unknown; no longer actively hostile, but allegiances remain unresolved.

### 🌌 The Barrier — Damaged but Stable

The immediate cult threat is eliminated. Barrier repair remains an open task:
- Requires several mages and a month or more of ritual work
- Replacement crystals available south of the Elven forest
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) (Odin) remains bound to the mortal realm until the barrier is fully restored

### 🎉 Party Achievements

- Summer's Edge reforged and awakened with limited truesight — wielded by [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)
- Tempest Egg recovered — [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) reclaimed his homeland's royal artifact
- Spring Leyline Temple cleared of corruption by Bodak
- Two of four Hollow Thresholds closed
- [Chained Library](/06---factions/chained-library) accessed; barrier repair knowledge obtained
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)'s true identity as Odin revealed
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s plans thwarted; [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s seal holds
