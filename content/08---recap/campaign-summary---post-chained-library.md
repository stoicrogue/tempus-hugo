**What began as a simple rescue became a fight for reality itself.**

When four unlikely heroes met in a quiet village tavern, they could not have known that answering a blacksmith's desperate plea would set them on a path to save the world. Tracking kidnappers into an ancient tomb, they stumbled upon something far more sinister—a dark ritual conducted by the **Cult of the Eclipse**, servants of a mysterious Lady promising that "darkness will descend once again."

And descend it did.

**The village of Tannis was swallowed whole by magical darkness**—an impenetrable void that threatened to consume everything. Only the intervention of the **Arbiter**, an angel of justice, contained the corruption. Marked by her divine symbol and tasked with finding the source, the heroes ventured into the enchanted Shimmerwood to seek the sage Vidrir.

What they discovered changed everything. The cult sought to corrupt the **leyline temples of the Fey Courts**—ancient structures maintaining the barrier between worlds. If the barrier fell, the dragon **Nidhogg** would be freed from the Shadowfell, and eternal darkness would reign.

**Across the four Courts they traveled**, earning the trust of fey nobility. In Winter, they hunted a Bandersnatch and defeated **Serenity**—a night hag agent of the cult who had been posing as a tavern singer. In Autumn, they faced the demon Xolthos at a harvest festival. In Summer, they encountered **Manus**, an enigmatic figure who mocks seemingly everyone, including the Weaver despite his cult affiliation.

To reforge **Summer's Edge**—a legendary blade of the Order of Seasons—the heroes journeyed deep into the Feywild to secure celestial ore and capture the first kiss of the midday sun. But time flows differently in that realm. While only days passed for them, weeks slipped by in the material plane.

**The cult seized their absence.** Orchestrated by **the Weaver**—a shadowy master of illusion serving the mysterious Lady of the Eclipse—cultists opened **Hollow Thresholds** across the realm: tears in reality where darkness bled through. By the time the party returned, the Spring temple had been corrupted. The heroes raced to the **Chained Library**, an ancient repository of forbidden knowledge, where they learned the terrible truth: Vidrir himself was the **Knight of Ravens**, the last survivor of the Order of Seasons, and he had been fighting this war for centuries.

Now the final confrontation looms. The Weaver prepares his ultimate ritual, seeking to tear open a portal and unleash Nidhogg upon the world. The heroes stand between civilization and annihilation, bearing a reforged blade and the hopes of two realms.

**Thirty-six days.** Four Courts. One legendary weapon. And the fate of all existence hanging in the balance.

The question is no longer whether darkness will come—but whether the light can hold.
