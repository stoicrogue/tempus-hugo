# Chamber 1 - Entrance

- When the entrance is approached, an Elvish voice asks for a token of proof they are worth of trust.
    - Solutions include an offer of blood, a symbol or amulet from the elves (Order of Seasons of the like), or a crystal leaf from the great maple tree.

# Chamber 2 - Tomb Guardian

- A Spectral Knight wearing silver Elven armor materializes and say they may pass if someone is brave enough to fight him in single combat.
    - Casts a cylindrical barrier at the start of combat to isolate the contest
    - AC = 17
    - HP = 40
    - Actions
        - Armor of Frost - +10 temp HP, rebukes hits with 5 frost damage
            - Cast by crushing a crystal overhead; dust forms into ice armor
        - Greatsword x2 - +5 to hit; 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage

# Chamber 3 - Chasm

- A narrow path over a “bottomless” chasm
- Anyone standing on the path is hit with beams of frost (+7 to hit; 2d8 cold damage) each round.
- The beams of frost emanate from 4 crystals 15 feet up on the walls of the cavern
    - Crystals have an AC of 10 and 1 HP; crystals will regenerate after 1 hour.
- It will take 10 rounds to cross the path to the other side.

  

# Chamber 4 - Leyline Crystal

- In the center of the hexagonal chamber, a large purple crystal is embedded in the floor.
- It is surrounded by a circle of ancient runes feintly flowing with energy
- At equal intervals in the circle of runes are smaller, similarly shaped crystals embedded in slots surrounded by additional runes.
    - There are four slots, but only three are currently filled.
