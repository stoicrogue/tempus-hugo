The stairway down the catacombs is inside the church, and locked. Only Father Samael can open the door with his key. He locks the door behind them, and tells the characters to knock twice in patterns of four to let him know it is them.

As the party explores the catacombs, they are hunted by the Snatcher.

Each time a character goes down a corridor, roll a d4. On a 1 or 2, the monster appears at the opposite end and gives chase.

The first time a character encounters the monster, they also encounter a villager who fled down here to hide. The monster then attacks this villager first and deals full damage to them. Then it gives chase to everyone else.

The monster is a bit slower than the characters, and the characters must hide, break line of sight, or distract the monster to escape it.

As an action, they can dig through old corpses in the corridors. Each corridor has a burial mound that has a 25% chance of containing a holy symbol. Once a number of holy symbols have been found—equal to one less than the total number of party members—they can find no more. (For example, if the party is made up of four characters, they can only find three holy symbols).

> When the monster kills that villager, this is the moment for a peak scary introduction. Describe to the players how much damage it deals to the villager. That way, they know how much mortal danger they are in if the creature gets to them.
