These dungeon hallways are stalked by the monster from the catacombs (the Snatcher)

Each X marked on the map is a possible area where the monster can be encountered.

Each time a character can see an X, roll a d4:

On a 1, the monster is there, ready to chase the characters down.

From then on, the monster hunts the characters and does not appear on any other X’s.

The monsters can only be killed if brought to the furnace and trapped inside.

## The Angel of Death

A bright, brilliant light shines in front of you. It’s nearly blinding, but you see a figure appear through it: a celestial being in golden armor, bearing white wings and a sword. She points at you and declares:

> Those who wear the symbols of the Dusk Lord, you have been forsaken. This place known as Tannis, has committed crimes against the Dusk Lord and must be extinguished. I have been granted the capability to destroy everything in this place in a holy, cleansing fire— including you all. Say your prayers, and prepare for death.
