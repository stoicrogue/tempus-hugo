# ðŸŒ‘ Read-Aloud: Vision of the Empty Loom

> _The world falls away like torn cloth._
> 
> _You stand in endless white, beneath a sky that has forgotten how to be blue._
> 
> _Before you looms a colossal frame, ancient beyond reckoning â€” a loom whose threads once sang with light and life._
> 
> _Now, you watch as strand by strand, the weave unravels.  
> Names you once knew. Faces you once loved.  
> Places you called home._
> 
> _They snap, one by one, vanishing into a silence so deep you feel it crushing your heart from the inside out._
> 
> _There is no malice here.  
> No violence.  
> Only the slow, inevitable undoing of all that ever was._
> 
> _And somewhere beyond the empty frame... something stirs, reaching through the cracks you cannot yet see._
