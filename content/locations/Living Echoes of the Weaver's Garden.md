### 1. **The Bloom of Forgotten Names**

**Location:**  
Nestled in a cracked stone planter along the left path.

**Description:**  
A single **silver-and-blue lily**, delicate but unearthly in color, grows stubbornly among withered vines.  
As the players approach, they notice faint glyphs carved into the planter — ancient Elvish sigils of _names, oaths, and promises_.

**Interaction:**
- If a player speaks **their own name aloud** while touching the lily,  
    the flower **flares with pale light**, and for a moment they hear a whispered memory — a voice they once loved, a forgotten friend, or an old teacher.
- Mechanically, this grants **Advantage on the next Wisdom saving throw** made within the garden.

### 2. **The Fountain of Fading Dreams**

**Location:**  
Near the center, a cracked marble fountain choked with mist.

**Description:**  
Instead of water, a **silver mist** pours endlessly from the mouths of sculpted fish and dryads.  
Looking directly into the mist reveals **fragmented visions** — flickers of the past and possible futures.

**Interaction:**
- A player who gazes into the mist for more than a few heartbeats sees **three fleeting images**:
    - A moment from their past they regret.
    - A shadowy threat looming over the land (perhaps a Hollow Threshold cracking open).
    - A veiled figure standing at a loom, weaving darkness.
- If a player **touches** the mist, they must succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom save** or be **haunted** (disadvantage on Insight/Perception checks) until they leave the garden.  
    Success grants **foresight** (Advantage on Initiative) in the first combat inside the castle.

### 3. **The Path of Wilting Footsteps**

**Location:**  
The right path, leading toward the broken arch.

**Description:**  
The **grass underfoot looks pristine** — vibrant green and gold — but the moment a living being steps upon it,  
their footsteps **leave blackened, wilting imprints**, as though life is being drained by their passing.

**Interaction:**
- Walking this path creates a **visible trail** marking where they have been.    
- If a player lingers too long in one place, the wilting spreads to form **shadowy vines** that grasp at their ankles — requiring a **DC 13 Dexterity save** to avoid being lightly restrained (flavor only, no damage yet).
- Burning the vines or using radiant magic causes them to **recoil and shrivel instantly**.
