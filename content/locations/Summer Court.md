**Architecture:** The Summer Court is styled like ancient Rome, with grand marble buildings, open courtyards, and majestic columns. The streets are bustling with activity, and the air is filled with the sounds of laughter, music, and the clang of metal from the forges.

**The Coliseum:** At the center of the Summer Court stands a massive coliseum, where games and contests of skill are held. The coliseum is an architectural marvel, with tiered seating that can accommodate thousands of spectators. The arena floor is versatile, capable of hosting a variety of events, from gladiatorial combat to archery contests.

**The Forge:** Elara's forge is located near the coliseum, a large open-air workshop filled with enchanted tools and materials. The forge's centerpiece is a massive anvil, inscribed with ancient runes, and a roaring forge fire that never seems to dim. The air is thick with the scent of molten metal and the hum of magical energy.

By introducing Elara Sunforge, the master smith of the Summer Court, you provide your party with a memorable and skilled NPC who can reforge the legendary blade, Summer's Edge. The setting of the Summer Court, with its Roman-inspired architecture and vibrant atmosphere, adds depth and richness to your campaign world. If you need further details or adjustments, feel free to let me know!

Here are a couple of brief ideas for materials the party could gather to earn Elara's trust and aid in reforging Summer's Edge:

### Practical Material: Celestial Ore

**Description:** Celestial Ore is a rare and powerful metal known for its exceptional magical conductivity and strength. It can only be found in certain meteorite craters where celestial bodies have impacted the material plane.

**Quest Idea:**

- **Location:** The party must travel to a remote and dangerous region where a meteorite has recently crashed. The crater is guarded by elemental creatures drawn to the powerful energies of the ore.
- **Challenge:** The party must navigate treacherous terrain, defeat elemental guardians, and mine the Celestial Ore from the heart of the crater. The ore is heavy and must be transported back to Elara's forge.

### Fantastical Material: The Kiss of the Midday Sun from the Feywild

**Description:** The Kiss of the Midday Sun is a radiant and ethereal substance that can only be gathered from the Feywild. It is said to be the essence of the sun's most powerful rays, captured at the peak of noon in the magical realm.

**Quest Idea:**

- **Location:** The party must find a portal to the Feywild, a realm of enchantment and danger. Once there, they must seek out the Sunlit Glade, a sacred place where the midday sun's power is at its strongest.
- **Challenge:** The party must navigate the unpredictable and ever-changing landscape of the Feywild, dealing with mischievous fey creatures and overcoming magical obstacles. To gather the Kiss of the Midday Sun, they must perform a ritual at precisely noon, using a special crystal to capture the sun's essence.

### Combination Material: Starforged Crystal

**Description:** Starforged Crystals are created when Celestial Ore is infused with the Kiss of the Midday Sun. The resulting crystal is incredibly powerful and can be used to enhance the reforging of legendary weapons.

**Quest Idea:**

- **Location:** The party must first gather the Celestial Ore from the meteorite crater. Then, they must travel to the Feywild and perform the ritual to capture the Kiss of the Midday Sun.
- **Challenge:** The process of infusing the Celestial Ore with the Kiss of the Midday Sun requires precise timing and coordination. The party must defend the ritual site from fey creatures and other magical threats while ensuring the infusion is successful.

### Example Dialogue from Elara

## **Introduction to the Quest:**

Elara examines the broken pieces of Summer's Edge with a critical eye, her fingers tracing the intricate runes etched into the blade. She looks up at you, her emerald eyes sparkling with determination.

"To reforge Summer's Edge, we need materials of extraordinary power. The blade was crafted with the essence of the sun and the strength of the stars. We will need Celestial Ore, a rare metal that fell from the heavens, and the Kiss of the Midday Sun from the Feywild. Only then can we restore this legendary weapon to its former glory."
