## ARENA LAYOUT
A 50-foot diameter circular platform of black stone floats in howling winds. Lightning crackles between three towering storm-spires (20ft tall, 5ft wide) arranged in a triangle around the center. The **Tempest Egg** hovers 10 feet above the platform's center, wreathed in electrical energy. A shimmering portal to the Material Plane sits at the platform's edge (south), while violent winds from the Air Plane tear through an unstable rift (north).

A perfect 50-foot diameter circular chamber of polished brass and silver gears. The floor is divided into concentric rings (10ft, 20ft, 30ft radii) that rotate slowly in alternating directions. Four mechanical pillars (15ft tall, 5ft wide) rise at cardinal points, each topped with a spinning gear-mechanism.

Thick roots create natural barriers and elevated platforms throughout the space. The **Bloodfang Talisman** rests atop a moss-covered altar at the center, pulsing with primal energy.

# HOLLOW THRESHOLD 4: THE CACOPHONY STAGE
**Plane Connection:** Material Plane ↔ Pandemonium

Four resonance crystals (12ft tall, 2ft wide) hum with chaotic frequencies at the corners, each glowing with different colored madness. The **Harmony of Madness** floats above a crystalline dais at the center, its music barely contained.
