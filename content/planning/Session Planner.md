# 💡 **Implementation Tips**

✅ **Use Obsidian callouts** for secrets, clues, and monster abilities to make them visually distinct.  
✅ **Font Size & Columns:** If exporting to Word or Google Docs for printing, use two columns to fit more while preserving clarity.  
✅ **Stat Blocks:** Continue your Forge of Foes workflow, pasting single-line blocks and appending unique abilities beneath.  
✅ **Treasure Streamlining:** Use abbreviated loot names with page references only when necessary.  
✅ **Narration Excerpts:** Place in a dedicated Obsidian note tagged #narration with links from your session file to keep print pages focused.

If you want, I can:

1. **Draft a CSS snippet** for Obsidian to format this template for clean two-column printing  
2. **Create an Obsidian template file** with collapsible sections ready for quick session prep insertion  
3. **Design a narrative and stat block card template** for separate print inserts for large dungeons like the Weaver’s Castle

Let me know which will most improve your preparation flow this week.
