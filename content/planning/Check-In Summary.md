# Tempus Campaign Check-In: Survey Summary

**Thanks to everyone who completed the survey! Here's what I'm hearing from the group:**

## What's Working Well
- **We love the world of Tempus** - Everyone wants to keep exploring it
- **Combat and tactical encounters** remain engaging for most players
- **The current storyline** has momentum - everyone wants to see how this arc ends
- **Group chemistry** is strong, with interest in collaborative storytelling

## Areas for Change
- **Pacing**: There's appetite to move through story beats more quickly, potentially using time skips
- **Setting variety**: Strong interest in exploring different parts of Tempus (desert, cities, ocean, other planes)
- **Character evolution**: Mixed feelings - some ready for dramatic character endings, others want to continue current characters
- **System exploration**: Most are open to trying different RPG systems (Shadowdark, Blades in the Dark, narrative systems)

## What You Want More Of
- **Puzzle-solving and social challenges** (convincing guards, sneaking out of prison without combat)
- **Character-driven roleplay scenes**
- **Exploration and discovery**
- **Big climactic moments**

## Moving Forward: My Proposal
Based on your feedback, here's what I'm thinking:

1. **Accelerate current arc** - Let's push toward resolution of the Weaver/Summer's Edge storyline
2. **Plan character transitions** - For those ready, we'll craft meaningful endings; others can continue
3. **Explore new settings** - After this arc, venture into unexplored parts of Tempus
4. **System experiments** - Try some one-shots with different systems to see what clicks
5. **GM rotation** - Explore having others run sessions or short arcs
