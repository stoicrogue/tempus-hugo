Thank you all for your thoughtful responses! Here’s a quick summary of what I heard and what it means for the campaign going forward:

---

**We’re Staying in Tempus**  
Everyone wants to keep playing in the world we’ve built together. There’s strong interest in seeing through key arcs like the Weaver’s legacy, Summer’s Edge, and the threat of the Cult. That’s awesome to hear.

**Character Arcs: Mythic Moments Ahead**  
Two of you are excited about giving your current characters big, dramatic conclusions. One is undecided but open, and one wants to continue with their current PC long-term. We’ll be planning for Shad’s exit in a way that’s emotionally powerful and opens the door for a new character connected to factions like the Chained Library or Massa’ista.

**Pacing & Time Skips**  
There’s shared interest in tightening the pacing. A few of you said you’d be happy to skip or fast-forward through less important beats to focus on the big scenes. We’ll look for moments where we can do short time skips, montages, or jump-cuts to make the story feel more cinematic while still honoring slower roleplay when it matters.

**System Curiosity & GM Flexibility**  
While no one’s asking to change systems now, there’s interest in trying other styles (like Dungeon World or Shadowdark) in one-shots or future arcs. Several of you are open to GM rotation or shared worldbuilding if the opportunity arises.

**Next Steps**  
We’ll stay in the world of Tempus and continue through the Weaver arc, moving toward reforging Summer’s Edge and confronting the portals. Steve will transition to a new character soon, which will give us a great story moment to rally around. I’ll aim to pace things more tightly and keep sessions focused on the emotional and narrative high points.
