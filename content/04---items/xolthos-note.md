Xolthos,

Our progress is swift, but vigilance is essential. The Shadow Dragon's freedom hinges on the weakening of the barrier. We must secure the leyline temples where the barrier is anchored.

The Winter Court's crystal has already been damaged. The next target lies within the territory of the Summer Court, where the master smiths reside. Disrupt their leyline crystal, and our victory draws closer.

Ensure the elimination of any who might interfere, particularly those who bear the marks of the Dusk Lord. Their resolve must be shattered.

Proceed with haste and discretion.

For the glory of the Eclipse!

â€”The Weaver
