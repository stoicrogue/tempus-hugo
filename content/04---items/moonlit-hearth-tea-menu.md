_Only one potent tea per guest between long rests. Effects last 1 hour unless noted. Teas don’t stack with themselves._

- **Moon’s Rest** – velvety lavender & oat.  
    _You feel safely held._ (Gain **5 temp HP** and advantage on **one** Save vs. fear taken during the duration.)
- **Spring’s Breath** – mint, willow-bark, dew gathered at dawn.  
    _Your lungs feel like open windows._ (**End** the **poisoned** condition or gain advantage on **Con saves vs. disease/poison** for the duration.)
- **Dewlight Focus** – rosemary, star-anise, lemon peel.  
    _Thoughts align like beads on a string._ (You have advantage on your **next Concentration save**; if unused within 1 hour, the boon fades.)
- **Greenwood Step** – nettle, young birch, a whisper of wild honey.  
    _Your feet remember deer paths._ (**+5 ft. speed** and advantage on **Stealth** checks in natural terrain.)
- **Petal Pact** – rosehip, apple blossom.  
    _Your words soften edges._ (Advantage on **one Charisma (Persuasion)** check made during a single conversation.)
- **Ward of the Hearth** – smoked chamomile, white sage.  
    _The room seems to lean in your favor._ (Before the duration ends, you may add **+1d4** to **one** saving throw or ability check.)
- **Starfall Memory** – blue cornflower, elderflower.  
    _Old knowledge falls into place._ (Advantage on **one** **Arcana**, **History**, or **Religion** check; if reading text, gain **Comprehend Languages (written only)** for **10 minutes**.)
- **Silver Augury** (ceremonial, 10 minutes) – moonwater, verbena, silent stir.  
    _The surface shows a pattern like spilled stars._ (Once, within the next hour, ask Seraphina a **yes/no** about a course of action within 30 minutes; she performs a gentle **Augury-style** reading.)

> **Pricing guide:** Common brews 3–5 gp; stronger effects 15–50 gp; **Silver Augury** 75 gp (or a favor sealed with a Moon Token).
