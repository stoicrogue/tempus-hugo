Homebrew and third-party magic items the party has acquired over the course of the campaign. These range from weapons like Summer's Edge and the Dagger of Darkness to utility items like the Bag of Starlight. You'll also find in-world documents like journal entries and intercepted notes that served as narrative hooks.

Most of these items were created as custom entries in D&D Beyond so the players could track them on their character sheets.
