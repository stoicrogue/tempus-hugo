# Aridni

These fey are more rugged and ruthless than normal pixies. Known as Aridni, they are a particularly greedy breed of bandits and kidnappers.

**Pale Archers:** Aridni are ashen-faced fey with gray moth wings that fire green-glowing arrows with a sneer and a curse. They prefer ranged combat whenever possible and are quite difficult to lure into melee. They sometimes accept a personal challenge or respond to accusations of cowardice.

**Caravan Raiders:** Aridni have developed different magical abilities that assist them well when they raid caravans for captives to enslave and sell. Charming foes into slavery is a favorite tactic.

**Wealth for Status:** Aridni delight in taking plunder from humans and dwarves, not so much for its own sake but as a sign of their power over mortals, and their contempt for those who lack fey blood.
