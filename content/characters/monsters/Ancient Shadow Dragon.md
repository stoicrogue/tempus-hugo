**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

## **Actions**

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the dragon is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## **Legendary Actions**

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

### Adjustments and Balancing

- **Scaling Difficulty:** If you find the dragon too powerful or not challenging enough during playtesting, adjust its hit points, AC, damage output, or the number of legendary resistances.
- **Minions and Environmental Hazards:** Consider adding minions or environmental hazards to the encounter to increase its complexity and difficulty.
- **Lair Actions:** If the battle takes place in the dragon's lair, include lair actions to add an additional layer of challenge and thematic elements.

### Conclusion

- **Suggested CR:** 13 to 15
- **Customization:** Adjust the dragon's stats, abilities, and additional encounter elements as needed to ensure a balanced and exciting battle for your party.
