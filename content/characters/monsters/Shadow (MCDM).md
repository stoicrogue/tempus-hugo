_**Chilling Phasing.**_ The shadow can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The shadow takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. A creature takes 1 cold damage the first time it passes through a shadow on a turn.

_**Dark Stalker.**_ While in dim light or darkness, the shadow has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

# Actions

## **Chilling Grasp**

Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) cold damage, and the target’s Dexterity score is reduced by 2. The target dies if this reduces its Dexterity to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

## **Freezing Dark (1/Day)**

The shadow pours magical darkness out of its hand in a 15-foot cone. A creature with darkvision who isn’t an incorporeal undead can’t see through this darkness, and light can’t illuminate it. Each creature in this darkness when it first appears must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) cold damage. The darkness remains in that area for 1 minute or until the shadow is destroyed.

# Bonus Actions

## _**Shadow Bind**_

The shadow targets one creature it can see within 15 feet of it who is in bright or dim light. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be grappled by its own shadow (escape DC 12). The grapple ends if the target is no longer in bright or dim light, or if the shadow who used this bonus action is destroyed.
