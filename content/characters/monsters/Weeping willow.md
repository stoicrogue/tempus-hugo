### Traits

**False Appearance.** While the willow remains motionless, they are indistinguishable from a normal willow tree.

**Flammable.** If the willow takes fire damage, they catch fire and take 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of their turns for 1 minute. The effect ends early if the willow takes cold damage or a creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The willow makes two _Frenzied Branch_ attacks.

**Frenzied Branch.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the willow is on fire, this attack deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage.

**Tugging Roots.** Roots erupt from a point on the ground the willow can see within 60 feet of them. Each creature in a 10-foot sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and moved up to 30 feet toward the willow, taking 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved.

**Willow’s Tears.** The willow showers salty droplets on their bower. Each creature within 15 feet of the willow must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the willow (_save ends at the end of turn_). While charmed in this way, a creature can’t willingly move more than 15 feet away from the willow. If a creature charmed in this way takes damage, the effect ends for them.

### Reactions

**Tree Transformation.** When a creature within 5 feet of the willow deals slashing damage to the willow, the willow attempts to turn the creature into a tree. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or their feet begin to transform into tree roots and they are restrained. A creature restrained in this way must repeat the saving throw at the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, they are transformed into a wooden tree and are _petrified_.

A creature petrified in this way resembles a normal tree of the same size as that creature, except the creature’s face appears carved into the trunk. If the willow dies, the petrification ends and the creature reverts to their true form. A _lesser restoration_ spell or similar magic also ends this effect.
