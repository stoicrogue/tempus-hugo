**Magic Resistance.** The pixie has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The pixieâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only its pixie dust as a component:

- At will: _druidcraft_
- 1/day each: _confusion_, _dancing lights_, _detect evil and good_, _detect thoughts_, _dispel magic_, _entangle_, _fly_, _phantasmal force_, _polymorph_, _sleep_

## Actions

**Superior Invisibility.** The pixie magically turns invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the pixie wears or carries is invisible with it.
