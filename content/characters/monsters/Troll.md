## Troll

_Large Giant, Typically Chaotic Evil_

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 94 (9d10 + 45)

**Speed** 40 ft.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
|18 (+4)|13 (+1)|20 (+5)|7 (−2)|9 (−1)|7 (−2)|

**Saving Throws** Con +8

**Skills** Athletics +7, Perception +5

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15

**Languages** Giant

**Proficiency Bonus** +3

### Traits

**Relentless Hunger.** When the troll is reduced to 0 hit points by any damage other than acid or fire damage, they don’t die or fall unconscious and can continue moving and taking actions as usual. The troll only dies if they end their turn with 0 hit points, if acid or fire damage reduces them to 0 hit points, or if they take acid or fire damage while they have 0 hit points.

**Sluggish.** For 1 hour after sleep or another period of unconsciousness, the troll’s speed is halved and they can’t use _Multiattack_.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The troll makes one _Bite_ attack and two _Claw_ attacks.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

_Hit:_ 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is not a Construct, an Elemental, or a Plant, the troll regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the troll regains twice as many hit points as they otherwise would with this attack.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Crash Through.** The troll moves up to their speed in a straight line, smashing through mundane obstacles in their path. The troll can enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures during this movement, forcing those creatures to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw.

- On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and falls prone.
- On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone.

During this move, mundane objects that aren’t worn or carried by a creature take 14 (4d6) damage when the troll enters their space. If the troll moves into the space of a Large or larger object and this damage doesn’t destroy it, the troll’s movement stops and they are _stunned_ until the end of their next turn.

### Reactions

**Spiteful Retort.** When the troll is reduced to 0 hit points and doesn’t die, they can make a _Bite_ attack against a creature within 5 feet of them.

### Traits

**Minion.** If the limbjumble takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, its hit points are reduced to 0. If the limbjumble takes damage from another effect, it dies if the damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum; otherwise, it takes no damage.

### Actions

**Arm and a Leg (Group Attack).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 2 bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller and if three or more limbjumbles joined the attack, the target is knocked prone.
