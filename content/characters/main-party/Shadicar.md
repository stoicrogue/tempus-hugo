**Race/Class:** Half-Elf Bard

**Background:** A charismatic performer and storyteller with a tragic past, Shadicar’s village was destroyed by a horrifying illusion conjured by the Weaver. Ever since, he's pursued knowledge and justice, weaving his sorrow into songs that inspire allies and unnerve enemies. He has formed a subtle rivalry (and perhaps infatuation) with Trius of the Winter Court and is often the party’s spokesperson and moral compass. Recently gifted the Fochlucan Bandore, his bardic magic has grown even more formidable.

**Notable Traits:** Silver tongue, emotionally intuitive, cunning gambler, carries the weight of personal loss.
