- Wizard, illusionist experimenting on how far illusions can go
- Responsible for the tragedy of Shadâ€™s village. He made an illusion so realistic the frightening that the villagers literally died of fear
- Stronghold is a tower in the Feywild. The tower is in the center of a mirage arcane spell that makes the tower look unreachable. It appears to be balanced on a spire in the center of a huge sinkhole.
- Not interested in helping the shadow dragon but thought it's image would make for a fantastic illusion.
- Willing to work with Serenity to get more data in his experiments. He was also behind the curse of Tannis.
