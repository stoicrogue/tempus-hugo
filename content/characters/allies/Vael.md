## Vael’s Explanation of the Anchors and Hollow Thresholds

(Vael stands still, his gloved hands clasped before him. His voice is quiet, but it carries — like a knife sliding under armor.)

> Vael:
> 
> "You have seen the cracks, have you not?
> The fading stars... the twisted woods... the monsters that slip between places where no door should stand."
> 
> (He tilts his head slightly, studying each of you.)
> 
> "The Elven barrier is not a wall. It is a tapestry — a weave of light and will, stitched across the wounds of the world. Each Temple you know — Winter, Summer, Autumn, Spring — holds one of the great knots, where the threads are pulled tight."
> 
> (He raises two fingers, sketching an invisible net between you.)
> 
> "But the weave would tear under its own weight without its anchors — lesser nodes, quiet stones buried in forgotten glades, riverbeds, mountaintops.
> 
> They keep the barrier taut. They spread the strain. They preserve the balance."
> 
> (His voice lowers, almost reverent.)
> 
> "And it is there — at these anchors — that the Cult of the Eclipse strikes. Not by tearing the Temples down... no. Not yet.
> 
> They corrupt the anchors. Weaken them. And where the threads slacken and sag, Hollow Thresholds bloom like rot beneath skin."
> 
> (Vael pauses, letting the image linger — the party can almost feel the weave trembling beneath their feet.)
> 
> "Each Threshold is a wound... a door to the Shadowfell... and a noose tightening around this world’s throat. If enough anchors fail — if enough hollows bloom — the barrier will fall. And what has long been sealed will walk once more under a broken sky."
> 
> (A breath.)
> 
> "You must understand. Slay the cultists if you wish. But it is not they who tear the world. It is the weave itself — fraying, thread by thread — that you must mend... or survive what comes after."
