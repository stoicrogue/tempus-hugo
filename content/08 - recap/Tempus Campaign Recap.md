## 📍 _Prologue – Tannis and the Blacksmith’s Plea_

- **The party meets in the Raven’s Perch Tavern** in the quiet village of Tannis and is introduced to key NPCs: Lerissa (retired adventurer), Serenity (mysterious singer), Hurmur (dwarven archaeologist), and Jax (Night Talons thief).    
- **Blacksmith Sig Rockwell bursts in**, begging for help to rescue his kidnapped daughter, Winry. He offers his finest work as payment.

## 🛡️ _Quest: Rescue the Blacksmith’s Daughter_

- **Tracked the captors north**, crossing into the enchanted Elven forest and finding a strange **obsidian standing stone** with a vision of landmarks to the NW and SE.
- Discovered an **ancient tomb of the Order of Seasons**, a knightly group sworn to fight darkness.
- Rescued Winry from a **dark ritual** conducted by goblins and a bugbear of the **Cult of the Eclipse**, who served a mysterious “Lady of the Eclipse.”
- Retrieved a **Cult medallion** marked with the phrase: _“Darkness will descend once again.”_
- Found a **hidden chamber of five knights**, and recovered magical gear and the **broken pieces of a longsword** marked with solar and avian symbols — possibly a legendary weapon.
- Returned Winry to her father, **receiving custom magical gear** and a promise from Sig to call in a future favor.

## 🌒 _The Darkness Falls on Tannis_

- **Shared findings with Lerissa**, who revealed legends of the _Knight of Ravens_, a hero of the Order of Seasons. She directed the party to seek the sage **Vidrir** in the Shimmerwood, suggesting they bring a cask of her ale as a goodwill offering.
- Noted strange celestial behavior: **half the stars missing** from the night sky.
- **Woke to panic** — the village engulfed in **magical darkness** impenetrable by light or darkvision.
- Fought off **shadowy hands** trying to drag villagers into the abyss and discovered a **magical barrier** trapping the town.
- Found temporary safety at Lerissa’s tavern, then crossed the village to the **church of the Dusk Lord**, the only sanctuary emitting light.
- **Met Father Samael**, who recalled showing a **black-haired woman** (presumably Serenity) his holy symbol — now missing.
- **Explored the church catacombs**, avoided a deadly shadow entity, and found their way to a secret chamber.
- Discovered and **parleyed with the Arbiter**, an **Angel of Justice**. She had created the barrier to contain the spreading corruption and was preparing a purge.
- Convinced her to delay her ritual and **earned her favor**: she **marked them with her symbol**, granting safe passage and the ability to commune with her.
- The Arbiter **destroyed remaining shadows** in the village but maintained the barrier until the source of the corruption could be found.
- **Skreek claimed a +1 Shield of the Dusk Lord** from the crypt.

## 🌿 _Journey to the Sage, Vidrir_

- **Used the Arbiter’s holy mark** to leave Tannis and travel through the Shimmerwood.
- **Met the sage Vidrir**, a friendly ally of Lerissa with mysterious insight and purple-winged raven familiars.
- Vidrir confirmed the broken sword is **Summer’s Edge**, a legendary blade once wielded by the Summer Court’s champion during the great war against the undead. Only **elven master smiths** could hope to reforge it.
- Revealed the **Eclipse medallion** was magically **trackable**, with the signal leading northwest.
- Skreek inquired about his stolen relic; Vidrir mentioned rumors of **djinn in the southern desert** searching for elemental artifacts.
- When Vidrir held Summer’s Edge, it **reacted faintly**, hinting at a dormant soul within the blade.

## 🧚 _Aid the Pixies and Uncover a Cult Plot_

- Tracked the medallion’s signal northwest, coinciding with Slumpet’s vision of the **silver maple** seen through the standing stone.
- **Slumpet befriended Fannie the pixie**, who warned of a **colorless region of forest** growing eerily still.
- Fannie asked for help rescuing kidnapped pixies from **Darklings** allied with the **Cult of the Eclipse**.
- **Toby, turned into a dinosaur by Fannie**, rampaged through the cultist camp. The party rescued the pixies and recovered:
    - Cult religious texts referencing a “**Great Shadow**”
    - Two **Daggers of Darkness**
    - A **note from ‘L’** about empowering a cultist via ritual, exploiting growing fear in the region

## 🕯️ _The Greyscale Cabin and the Truth about Serenity_

- Entered the corrupted woods and found a **cabin guarded by a Flameskull**. After defeating it, Slumpet kept the skull as a trophy.
- Discovered signs of **Serenity’s presence** in the cabin and were attacked by a **Rug of Smothering**, later named “Sassy Tassels.”
- Found a **defiled altar to a shadow dragon** with a **magical crystal orb** and a diorama of Tannis. Using their holy marks, they summoned the **Arbiter**, who confirmed this site as the source of the Dusk Lord’s wrath and cleansed it. She departed to lift the barrier over Tannis.
- The next morning, the **hag Serenity revealed herself** and demanded the return of the orb. The party refused, and combat broke out.
- Shad’s **charm person spell unexpectedly succeeded**, pacifying Serenity and allowing them to gather intel:
    - Serenity served a caster named **the Weaver**, a master of fear and illusion.
    - Serenity cursed Tannis to earn favor with **Nidhogg**, a **shadow dragon** who **hates the Dusk Lord**.
    - The Weaver was responsible for the **illusion-based massacre of Shad’s village**, using a false vision of Nidhogg.
- The party **fled while Serenity was still charmed**, with Slumpet carrying the orb.
- Along the way, the **Flameskull revived itself** as **Francis** and struck a deal with the party: in exchange for adventure and action, he would provide his **laser-eye beams and arcane knowledge**.

## 🐉 _The Shadow of Nidhogg Revealed_

- Returned to **Vidrir’s grove** to rest and regroup. Francis the Flameskull was **repelled by undead wards**, revealing Vidrir’s home was protected against such creatures.
- Vidrir examined **Serenity’s dark orb**, identifying it as a **seeing stone**—useful for communication, tracking, and divination.
- He grew deeply alarmed when learning Serenity had contacted **Nidhogg**, the shadow dragon sealed in the **Shadowfell** by the Order of Seasons during a great war centuries ago.
- Vidrir’s cryptic remarks hinted he may have **personally fought in that war**, revealing a depth of history and power previously unspoken.
- Advised the party to seek out the **Winter Court** for further knowledge of Nidhogg, the orb, and the reforging of **Summer’s Edge**. He gifted them his **Order of Seasons medallion** to gain an audience with the Lady of Winter.

## ❄️ _First Contact with the Winter Court_

- Traveled north toward the **silver maple** tree. En route, the party:
    - Defeated a **Redcap assassin** hired to stop them.
    - Spotted a **strange feline predator** tearing holes in reality and avoided its path.
- Found a **Winter Court standing stone** and made peaceful contact with **elven rangers** by showing Vidrir’s medallion.
- Arrived at the **Winter Court embassy**, a well-kept elven village with shops, an inn (_The Restful Buck_), and a faint sci-fi aesthetic powered by blue crystal tech.
- Shad performed at the inn, and the party learned:
    - The Lady of Winter was **Alora**.
    - Her daughter, **Olivia**, had recently been **poisoned**—possibly by a creature called a **Bandersnatch**.
- Gained a private audience with Alora after **Skreek healed Olivia** with Lay on Hands. Grateful, Alora opened up about the weakening of the **interplanar barrier**, which was allowing monsters to breach into the material plane.

## 🦷 _Quest: Hunt the Bandersnatch_

- Accepted Alora’s offer to **hunt the Bandersnatch** that poisoned Olivia.    
- Used clever tactics and **Slumpet’s squirrel network** to bait and trap the creature. Despite its poison gas and claws, the party was victorious.
- Returned the beast’s **severed head** to Alora, who rewarded them each with a **powerful magic item**:
    - **Slumpet**: _Relentless Hunter_ (shortbow with _Hunter’s Mark_)
    - **Shad**: _Fochlucan Bandore_ (bardic instrument)
    - **Toby**: _Blinkback Belt_ (auto-retrieving thrown weapons)
    - **Skreek**: _Frostbrand Scimitar_ (cold damage)
- Learned more about the **barrier’s origin**, which was forged by Alora’s mother using ancient power. Since no one of her lineage has inherited her gift, the barrier is weakening.
- Alora asked the party to investigate a nearby **leyline temple** that sustains part of the barrier.
- **Trius**, Alora’s eldest daughter and a paladin wielding a **moonblade**, made an impression on the group—especially Shadicar. Though intrigued by their quest, she initially declined to join them.

## 🛡️ _Journey to the Winter Leyline Temple_

- After a night of rest and **unsettling dreams of Serenity reclaiming the orb**, the party prepared to depart. With some persuasion and the promise of excitement, **Trius** agreed to accompany them to the leyline temple.
- The party traveled east on horseback (with Trius riding a **majestic unicorn**) toward a **temple of ancient origin** embedded in the hillside — **unlike any elven or dwarven structure they'd seen**.
- At the entrance, a magical voice demanded proof of worthiness:
    - **Shadicar**: a bardic song of Elven legend
    - **Skreek**: scroll proving his lineage
    - **Slumpet**: failed with Serenity’s orb, succeeded with Alora’s gifted bow
    - **Toby**: blood sacrifice
    - **Trius**: her family’s Moonblade  
        These offerings were accepted, and the temple opened like a **mechanical iris**.

## ⚔️ _Temple Trials of the Ancient Order_

- **First Chamber**: Greeted by a **holographic knight** requesting a duel. **Skreek** met the challenge and defeated the guardian honorably, unlocking the next door.    
- **Second Chamber**: A perilous 300-foot bridge over a chasm with tiles bearing **seasonal glyphs**. Missteps triggered **laser traps** from the walls. With flight, acrobatics, and deduction, the party made it across.
- **Final Chamber**: A breathtaking nexus of power, centered on a **giant purple leyline crystal** surrounded by six hovering **arcane focus crystals**.
    - The **glyphs** referenced "planes," "barrier," and "leyline."
    - One of the six crystals was **cracked and flickering**, indicating a possible failure in the arcane network.
- **Slumpet recorded the runes** by making a rubbing, and **Skreek contacted the Arbiter**, who explained that **leylines channel the raw magic of the world**, which can be used for power, communication, or traversal.
- With no further threats or puzzles, the party exited the temple, ready to **report their findings to Alora**.

## 🌑 _Final Showdown with Serenity_

- On the road back from the leyline temple, the forest’s **colors drained into grayscale**, and the party unexpectedly arrived at **Serenity’s cabin** once more.    
- Serenity, revealing her true **night hag form**, demanded her crystal orb and launched an ambush. 
- **Trius joined the battle**, sword drawn and projecting a **mental battle hymn** that inspired the party.
- Serenity animated the **party’s shadows** as enemies and revealed her **“cloak” was a manta-like creature**, capable of absorbing damage and creating illusory copies.
- After a **brutal, all-hands battle**, Serenity and the shadow creatures were slain. Her cloak escaped.
- Shad used a scroll of **Speak with Dead**, and Serenity grudgingly answered:
    - She was **over 300 years old**
    - **The Weaver** destroyed Shad’s village “for amusement”
    - **She wasn’t responsible** for the Elven barrier’s weakening
- She refused to share the **Weaver’s location** or her **breakfast recipe**.
- The party looted her body, finding:
    - An **emerald ring** that opens a **small storage dimension**
    - A **gold necklace** that **protects the mind from magical probing**
- After looting her cabin, they **burned both the body and the building** to ensure Serenity would not return.

## 🧭 _Reporting to Alora and Discovering the Larger Plan_

- Returned to the Winter Court and reported both:
    - Serenity’s permanent defeat
    - The **damaged leyline crystal**
- Alora was troubled by the crack but **didn’t know how to repair it**.
- As a reward, she gifted the party a **silver teleportation ring**:
    - When attuned to an **obsidian standing stone**, it allows teleportation between attuned stones.
- The next morning, **Arch Magus Levi** joined Alora in briefing the party:
    - The **barrier is anchored by four leyline temples**, one in each seasonal domain.
    - **Alora’s mother’s journal** referenced an ancient site called **The Chained Library**, likely the original source of the barrier ritual.
    - The Chained Library may still exist and may **seek out forbidden artifacts** like the orb.
- During this meeting, **Slumpet stole a map of the Dwarven capital** from Alora’s desk, raising questions about her connection to the Dwarves.

## 🍂 _Journey to the Autumn Court_

- On the road east, the party was **ambushed by fey thieves** (Quicklings and Aridni), but prevailed and recovered stolen coin.
- Discovered a **Torii gate and standing stone** at the tranquil entrance to the **Autumn Court**.

## 🍁 _Darkness at the Fall Festival_

- Arrived during a seasonal festival at the **Aki Matsuri beer garden**, hosted by the **earth genasi monk Hencelle**, the "Master of Feasts."
- Befriended **Ali**, a bounty hunter working for the secretive information guild , the **Massa’Ista**; his captive **Arden** may help identify magic items.
- **Xolthos, a black dragonborn sorcerer and agent of the Eclipse**, disrupted the festival with an ominous speech:
    - Proclaimed the **return of Nidhogg**
    - Warned of more **attacks on leyline temples**
- After **banishing Shad mid-taunt**, Xolthos was defeated in a tough battle. Slumpet's **stardust** prevented him from using shadow magic.
- Looted magic items from Xolthos:
    - **Tiny dragon figurine**
    - **Invisibility ring**
    - **Enchanted robes**
    - **Magic staff**
- Found a **letter from the Weaver**, confirming:
    - The **Winter leyline crystal** was already damaged
    - The **Summer Court’s leyline** is the **next target**
    - All **marked by the Dusk Lord** are enemies

## 🧠 _Audience with Farkris & Entry to the Autumn Temple_

- Gained an audience with **Lord Farkris**, leader of the Autumn Court:    
    - Regretted failing to make peace with Nidhogg centuries ago
    - Shocked to learn the barrier is weakening — Alora had not warned him
    - Granted permission to explore the **Autumn Leyline Temple**
- Proved their worth to a **guardian treant** by **saving a baby unicorn** from bloodthirsty vines during a dire wolf ambush
- Gained entrance to the temple through a **hill peeled open by ancient magic**
- Solved a **rotating seasonal puzzle** depicting the **cycle of autumn**
- Inside, found the leyline crystal and its six focus crystals **intact and stable**

## 🧭 _Transition to the Summer Court_

- Camped in the treant’s grove, then scouted east toward **Summer’s lands**    
- Used the standing stone near a massive **silver birch tree** to **attune their teleportation ring**, then returned to the Aki Matsuri for one last restful night (and **drink roulette**).
- Returned to the Summer border — teleportation **miraculously cured Shad’s hangover**

## ⚔️ _The Battlefield of the Eclipse_

- Discovered a site with **arcane runes** burned into the ground — likely the **battlefield where Nidhogg was sealed**    
- Encountered **cultists performing a ritual**:
    - Party ambushed the enemy        
    - Defeated a mage named **Kharvax**, along with an ogre and mercenaries
    - Francis delighted in laser-eye-beaming the foes
- Two mercs surrendered and shared cult plans in exchange for their lives
- **Shad used Mantle of Whispers** to absorb Kharvax’s shadow and learned:
    - The **Weaver’s stronghold is in the Feywild**
    - They hope to use the old **Nidhogg sealing ritual** to **enhance summoning magic**
    - Kharvax had tested this by summoning a basilisk, which killed some cultists
- Looted:
    - **+1 Vampiric Scythe**
    - **Grimoire of the Eclipse**, containing:
        - _Summon Shadowspawn_
        - _Shadow Blade_
        - _Contact Other Plane_

## ☀️ _Arrival in the Summer Court_

- After leaving the ancient battlefield, the party reached the **Summer Court**, known for its **competitive culture** and bold street food.
- Discovered a **standing stone near the coliseum** and attuned it for teleportation.
- Visited **Ember’s Embrace**, a lively inn run by **Serra Flamekissed**, a fire genasi who introduced them to **flaming shots**.
- The next day, met with **Lady Sylvia** of the Summer Court, who asked them to check on the **Summer Leyline Temple**.

## 🔥 _Summer Temple Sabotage and the Duel with Manus_

- Found the temple **already breached**; two **guardian constructs** were destroyed by **fire and ice magic**.
- Discovered the **leyline crystal chamber** had one of its eight rune crystals **entirely missing**.
- Outside, encountered **Manus**, a trickster warrior posing as Trius. He:
    - **Mocked the Weaver and the cult** despite seeming to be allied with the cult
    - Wants to test his skills against strong opponents,  but the Weaver would only fight Manus after the cult accomplished its goal.
    - **Offered the crystal** if they could **land one blow** on him
- The party struggled to even touch him—until **Slumpet’s ball bearings** landed a hit. True to his word, Manus handed over the crystal and vanished.
- Back in the temple, attempts to restore the crystal failed. The **Arbiter suggested** it might be **tainted** or need a **ritual**.
- Shad used **Contact Other Plane** to reach **Maria**, Alora’s mother:
    - **Party cannot fix the crystal**
    - **Summer Court lacks the means**
    - **Chained Library holds the answers**
    - **Winter Court knows nothing**
    - **The center of Elven territory may help**

## 🔄 _The Broken Loop and the Merchant of Secrets_

- While returning to the Summer Court, the party entered a **temporal loop** in the forest:
    - Experienced **repeating scenery**, **time distortions**, and **deja vu**
    - Noticed signs of the **escaped basilisk** from Kharvax’s failed ritual
- Discovered **Blackbird**, a **raven-like eldritch merchant** who trades in **secrets and contracts**.
- Blackbird offered help **in exchange for a magical contract** with Toby:
    - For **three nights**, she must **pay for everyone’s drinks**
    - Violation will result in **psychic damage**
    - The contract manifests as an invisible bracelet Toby feels on her wrist.
- Blackbird returned with a **charm that played a metal tune** (“take control”), which helped Toby **navigate the loop** and **lead the party out safely**.

## ⚔️ _Back in the Summer Court: Reforging Summer’s Edge_

- After escaping the forest loop, the party returned to the **Summer Court**, where they:
    - Fulfilled night 1 of **Blackbird’s drink contract** (98 drinks = 19gp)
    - Shad tried (and failed) to perform badly enough to clear the tavern
- Met with **Lady Sylvia**, who:
    - Was surprised but not hostile about the party having **Summer’s Edge**
    - Confirmed the sword **chooses its wielder**
    - Directed them to **Elara Sunforge**, the realm’s top smith
- Elara was thrilled to help, but needed two components:
    - **Celestial Ore** from the **Starfall Crater**
    - The **First Kiss of the Midday Sun** from the **Feywild**

## 🌠 _Starfall Crater and the Celestial Guardian_

- Traveled north to a **meteor crater**, filled with glowing alien stone, swirling mist, and a song-like hum of cosmic energy.
- Battled four **Starfall Sentinels** and a larger, intelligent **Celestial Guardian** wielding a blade of starlight.
- After a hard-won victory, the **pedestal cracked**, revealing enough **Celestial Ore** to meet Elara’s needs.

## 🛍️ _Shopping and the Shimmering Glade_

- Returned to Elara with the ore; she confirmed it was suitable.
- She found a nearby **Fey crossing**: the **Shimmering Glade**
- Shopped at the **Glittering Cavern**, where **Toby purchased oddly specific items** (moonstones, salt, bells, milk, etc.) in anticipation of Fey dealings.
- Fulfilled **night 2** of Blackbird’s contract—more expensive this time, but manageable.
- The next morning, ventured to the **Shimmering Glade**, a radiant clearing filled with latent magic and a ring of ancient standing stones.

## 🐾 _Squid Cats and the Crossing to the Feywild_

- Found a **six-legged “squid cat” mother** (Displacer Beast) and her cubs in the center of the glade.    
- Attempted diplomacy instead of battle:
    - **Toby lured the cubs away with milk**
    - **Slumpet spotted a misaligned crystal**
    - **Shad adjusted the crystal with a boost from Skreek**
    - **Skreek stunned the squid cat with leftover catnip**       
- With the cubs safe and the threat avoided, the crystals activated and projected a **portal to the Feywild**
- **Toby dove in first**, emerging in a vivid realm of riotous colors and surreal vegetation
- As the rest of the party joined her, she turned and smirked:
	- “Welcome to the Feywild, kids…”

## 🌈 _Welcome to the Feywild_

- The party crossed into the **Feywild** via the **Shimmering Glade**, finding themselves in a lush, colorful world of exaggerated flora and strange energy.
- Skreek scouted from above and spotted a **mountain to the northwest**—a prime location to capture the **First Kiss of the Midday Sun**.
- Journeyed to **Medusa’s Wake**, a lagoon-ruin believed to be the site of a battle between a **medusa and a storm giant**.
- Discovered a **festival of satyrs** led by **Revel Pipesong**. Shad disguised himself and gave a musical performance with Skreek’s invisible help.
- Party learned the trail up the mountain began at the satyr camp.
- Engaged in a **magical drinking game**:
    - Skreek now **speaks only in rhyme** for 7 days
    - Toby bursts into **inappropriate laughter**
    - Shad’s **hair becomes flowering vines** when lying or breaking promises
- Declined Revel’s offer of “a single night of unbridled joy in exchange for a future favor”

## ☀️ _The First Kiss of the Midday Sun_

- Toby wakes up and realizes that Blackbird's contract bracelet is gone, which signals:
	- Time passes differently in the Feywild
	- The contract has been fulfilled
- Began the **ascent of the mountain** the next morning with Elara’s capturing device in hand.    
- Encountered a **moss-covered fey troll** guarding a pass:
    - Each strike spawned **animated flesh clones**
    - After a difficult battle, the party continued upward
- At the mountain peak, **Skreek beheld a vision** while holding the shards of **Summer’s Edge**:
    - A memory of the sword being gifted to a champion by the **Queen of the Summer Court**
    - A battlefield vision disrupted by darkness and shattering fragments
- In the distance, the party saw a **twisted black castle**—gothic, shifting, and _watching_—which hadn’t been there a moment ago... or perhaps always had.
- At a **ceremonial altar**, Slumpet placed Elara’s device to capture the sun’s essence.
- As the sun’s light bathed the altar, **Summer’s Edge began to stir**, resonating with the light and Skreek’s presence.

## 🃏 _A Duel with Manus, Again_

- **Manus appeared**, taunting the party:    
	- “Drawing broken swords now, bird? I do hope you brought sharper company.”
- Created **magical darkness** around Elara’s device and summoned **two clones** on the cliffs above.
- Only Skreek could perceive within the darkness, thanks to his **blindsight**.
- Shad dispelled the darkness, drawing mocking praise from Manus.
- After several rounds of fighting, **Manus called off the battle**, vanishing with a final taunt and leaving the party winded but intact.
- Elara’s device **completed its capture**—a soft, warm pulse confirmed that the **First Kiss of the Midday Sun** had been secured.

## 🏰 _The Forgotten Castle_

- With both **Celestial Ore** and the **Midday Sun’s essence**, the party is now ready to **reforge Summer’s Edge**.
- Unsure how to return from the Feywild, they decide to **retrace their steps to the Shimmering Glade**.
- But before that, they’ve chosen to **investigate the eerie gothic castle** seen from the peak…
    - Though its presence is unsettling, it calls to them with **irresistible gravity**.
- The party explored a **mysterious Feywild castle**, seemingly conjured into view. Its illusions shimmered between reality and unreality, and signs of enchantment were everywhere.
- At the gates, they faced a **riddle-speaking patchwork knight**, passing its test to gain entry:
    - Love, the tongue, and humanity — each answer a key to the path ahead.
- Inside, mirrors showed **distorted visions of self**:
    - **Shad** rejected a hollow legacy of applause and escaped harm thanks to Serenity’s necklace.
    - **Skreek** accepted a vision of lonely heroism and gained a boon of luck.
    - **Slumpet** rejected visions of betrayal and was psychically wounded.
    - **Toby** embraced her monstrous reflection and earned a boon of luck.
    - A final glance from Toby hinted at a **loom unraveling the fabric of the world*

### 🧵 _The Loom Chamber_

- A massive broken **loom pulsed with dark illusion magic**, clearly crafted by a master.
- Shad disrupted the loom with thunderwave; Francis incinerated it at Shad’s request.
- The room triggered hallucinations and memory loss — suggesting the **loom once held influence over perception or identity**.
- Shad’s decision to destroy the loom marked a turning point: he accepted responsibility for unmaking something integral to the castle’s design.    

### 👁 _The Echo of the Weaver_

- In the **throne room**, the party met the **Echo**, a spectral remnant of the Weaver’s soul, bound to the castle.
- The Echo recognized Shad as the one who destroyed the loom and demanded payment — a **soul** to rebuild it.
- When the party refused, he summoned **two wolves of shadow** and attempted to extract Shad’s soul by force.
    - Shad survived the Echo’s powerful assaults thanks to uncanny luck and Serenity’s amulet.
    - Slumpet struck the decisive blow from the shadows, unraveling the Echo and banishing his summoned wolves.        

### 📜 _Revelations in the Weaver’s Study_

- Behind a hidden tapestry, the party found the **Weaver’s study** and journal.
- The journal revealed:
    - The **power of fear** and illusion shaped the Weaver’s philosophy.
    - Illusions could be tied to **triggers, emotions**, and even bound to places and **events**.
    - The Weaver discovered and mastered **Mirage Arcane**, allowing him to **reshape reality** entirely.
    - His final entries describe a plan to **weaken the leyline network** and release **Nidhogg** by unraveling the threads anchoring the planes.
    - A **spell that can tether his soul to paper**, known as **Silmirien**, can **call him home** if a page is burned.
- Slumpet also found a **map of leyline energy** and leyline temple locations, marked with several **“Hollow Thresholds”**—unexplained but likely significant to the cult’s portal activities. He **kept this map secret**, considering its potential value to his mysterious dwarven contacts.

## 🏰 _An Unexpected Refuge_

- After defeating the Weaver’s Echo, the party rested within the now-quiet Feywild castle. By morning, the oppressive illusions had faded, revealing a place touched by warmth and light.
- Exploring further, they discovered a hidden stairwell behind a tapestry, leading to an ancient chamber of quartz-veined stone beneath the castle.
- At its center stood an obsidian standing stone—identical to others they had seen—surrounded by a dormant teleportation circle. Skreek recognized the design from his homeland.
- The patchwork guardian returned, proclaiming the party the new owners of the castle. They named him “Jeeves,” and he pledged to restore the structure and shape it to their needs.
- Slumpet attuned their Leyline Gate Ring to the stone, and the party used it to return to the Summer Court.

## 🔨 _Reforging Summer’s Edge_

- Elara welcomed the party back to the Summer Court, relieved after their long absence. The lingering Feywild magic faded, restoring the group to normal.
- She confirmed the party had retrieved the “First Kiss of the Midday Sun” and led them to an ancient leyline forge beneath her shop.
- Using the sun’s essence and celestial ore, Elara reforged the legendary blade with reverence. At the final strike, she offered the completed weapon to Skreek.
- As Skreek took up Summer’s Edge, he felt its radiant will awaken—offering a wordless vow of purpose and unity.
- Elara provided a temporary scabbard and promised to craft a more fitting one in time. The party departed to celebrate at Ember’s Embrace.
- Over drinks with Serra Flamekissed, they planned their next journey—to check on Tannis via the standing stone near the Order’s tomb. Before retiring, Shad purchased a scroll of _Legend Lore_, eager to learn more about the looming darkness.
