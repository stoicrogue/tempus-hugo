> Various types of notes capturing the ongoing campaign.
> - **Tempus Campaign Session Notes:** a fairly raw combination of all of session notes captured during play and transferred back to my Obsidian Session Notes.
> - **Tempus Campaign Recap:** a summary of the raw session notes. I start by feeding a section of raw session notes into ChatGPT and refine a bit from there. These are ready to share with the players. 
> - **Tempus Campaign Dramatization:** a prose version of the raw session notes. Again, I start by feeding a section of raw session notes into ChatGPT and refine a bit from there. Throughout the campaign, I've been updating this document and sharing it with the players. In a long running campaign, I feel like this has ended up being very helpful for the entire group.
