### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

- [Donjon Random Treasure Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/random/#type=treasure;treasure-cr=4;treasure-loot_type=treasure_hoard)

### Session Notes

- Shad convinces Francis he deserves a hug because they have grown so close after defeating Serenity
- Meet with Alora and her wizard, Levi
- Levi and Alora told the party about the [[Tempus/Tempus Campaign/Campaign Database/Chained Library]]
    - Alora said her mother’s journal mentions the library and surmises that she may have learned about the barrier ritual from a forbidden tome from the library.
    - Unfortunately, almost no one knows where the library is located
    - Library agents are rumored to search for forbidden knowledge, books, and artifacts. They may seek out the party if they know they possess such an artifact.
- Party attunes their teleportation ring to two standing stones in Winter’s domain: outside the court and next to the great silver tree.
- The party leaves Winter to travel to Autumn
- On the way, a Quickling steals Toby’s coin purse. The party pursues and ends up in an ambush by several Quicklings and Aridni thieves.
