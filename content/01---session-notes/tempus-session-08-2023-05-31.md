# Strong Start

    - [x] Fannie’s friends are being held captive by a group of grey-skinned halflings ([Darkling](/02---characters/monsters/darkling))
    - [x] The party agreed to help Fannie rescue her friends and will turn [October “Toby” Daye](/02---characters/main-party/october-toby-daye) into a dinosaur to help them storm the camp

# Scenes

# Secret and Clues

_Check off when revealed_

- [ ] Darklings work for [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)
- [ ] [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)’s lair is in the elven forest north of the camp
    - [x] Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.
    - [ ] Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a minute or two, and then returned to the place where they vanished from.
    - [x] Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves littering the hag’s realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

- [Dagger of Darkness](/04---items/dagger-of-darkness)

## Scratchpad

_Jot down notes during your game. Use it for a text-based combat tracker or anything else. Copy and paste from here into Discord for example. Here's more on [playing D&D and Discord](https://slyflourish.com/playing_dnd_over_discord.html) and a [Markdown-based battle map](https://slyflourish.com/text-based_battle_maps.html)._
