# Secret and Clues

_Check off when revealed_

- [x] [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) is a night hag
- [ ] [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)’s lair is in the elven forest
    - [ ] Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.
    - [ ] Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a minute or two, and then returned to the place where they vanished from.
    - [ ] Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves littering the hag’s realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.
- [ ] [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) has wielded [Summer’s Edge (orig)](/04---items/summers-edge-orig)

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

- [Donjon Random Treasure Generator](https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/random/#type=treasure;treasure-cr=4;treasure-loot_type=treasure_hoard)
- [Dagger of Darkness](/04---items/dagger-of-darkness)

## Scratchpad

_Jot down notes during your game. Use it for a text-based combat tracker or anything else. Copy and paste from here into Discord for example. Here's more on [playing D&D and Discord](https://slyflourish.com/playing_dnd_over_discord.html) and a [Markdown-based battle map](https://slyflourish.com/text-based_battle_maps.html)._

### Session Notes

- [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) had vivid nightmares of the day his village was destroyed
    - [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) was in his dream, chaos all around her. When Shad noticed her, he was thrust out of the dream
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) asked to hold the pieces of [Summer’s Edge (orig)](/04---items/summers-edge-orig) before the party left.
    - When he held the sword, his hair slightly stood on end, and a warm smile washed over his face. He seemed grateful and made the party promise to return when the sword is reforged so he could see it in all its glory.
- Befriended a pixie named Fannie in the forest by playing along with her pranks.
- Fannie’s friends are being held captive by a group of grey-skinned halflings ([Darkling](/02---characters/monsters/darkling))?
- The party agreed to help Fannie rescue her friends and will turn [October “Toby” Daye](/02---characters/main-party/october-toby-daye) into a dinosaur to help them storm the camp
- [Slumpet Zoommimist](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) scouted ahead and found the camp where the pixies are being held
