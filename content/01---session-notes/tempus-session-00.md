## Campaign Pitch

| **Characteristic** | **Quality** |
| --- | --- |
| Player Driven | High  |
| Weird | High |
| Politics | Medium, but potentially escalating |
| Game System | D&D 5e |
| Starting Character Level | Low  |
| Setting | Homebrew |

A tense stalemate exists between Elves, masters of magic and the planes, and Dwarves, experts of crafting and technology.  If either side could gain the upper hand over the other, the possible devastation would be immeasurable.  You are currently residents of a relatively small, but importantly situated, “third world” nation caught up in the chaos of the superpowers' fight for supremacy.  The nature vs technology worldviews of the Elves and Dwarves are at the heart of the lasting distrust and conflict.

Depending on the group's interests, we can focus on the Dwarven kingdoms and dive into themes of science fantasy, or we can focus on the Elven kingdoms and explore themes of the Feywild (Fey courts, faeries, etc.).  I have adventures in mind for each.  If the campaign runs long enough, we might even be able to explore both.

The player characters are likely members of an up-and-coming mercenary company, thieves guild, or simply neighbors rising up against a local threat.  In your early adventuring career, the cold war between the Elves and Dwarves may not be directly relevant to you, but as you gain power, abilities, wealth, and allies, build strongholds, or recruit followers, you will draw the attention of more powerful agents of the superpowers themselves…

# Campaign Tenants & Player Buy-in

## Character Options

Any official D&D products for classes, races, feats, etc are fair game.  If you find some homebrew stuff online you’d rather use to create your character, just let me know, and we’ll talk it through.

## Player Ambition

What I think might be exciting is a game where we are all playing to find out what happens next and learn more about the campaign world together.  Not every player needs to “want” something, but if no one wants to build a castle, recover a famous artifact, join the Hawklords, or start a Thieves’ Guild, then I sort of feel as if we could just be playing a board game.

## Collaborative World Building

I'll occasionally turn to you all during a play session and ask questions about the world that your character might be an expert about:  Why do elves live so long? How common are Dragonborn in this world?  Who makes the best whiskey in all the land?  What is rumored to be in the Forbidden Forest?

## Weird Elements

Planar influence, celestial and demonic entanglements, and science fantasy are all very exciting to me! Who knows how they might manifest in the game?

## Theatre of the Mind Combat

I enjoy thinking tactically and designing challenging situations, but I'm not all that interested in playing with minis on a grid.  We may occasionally sketch out a rough map or put tokens on the table to represent relative positions during a complex encounter, but our imaginations are powerful, and I'd like to use those as much as possible.
