# Strong Start

- [x] After exiting the church, you see a flash of light as the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) teleports to a spot high above the great oak tree, her wings unfurling with a thunderous clap that sends a shockwave through the town. Her divine aura emanates outwards, causing the town square below her to glow with a brilliant golden light. With a swift motion, the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) unsheathes her greatsword, its gleaming blade pulsing with divine energy. She raises it high above her head, and in a voice that echoes through the town, she intones an ancient incantation in celestial. As she finishes the incantation, the blade of her sword shatters into a thousand shards of light, each one piercing the darkness like a bolt of lightning. The shards arc outwards, each seeking out a shadow monster with deadly precision. In an instant, the creatures are destroyed. The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) lowers her sword, the shards reforming into the sword’s original shape with a brilliant flash of light. As she sheathes her weapon, the divine aura around her begins to fade as the darkness returns. True to the angel’s word, the town is now safe from the monsters, but the darkness returns.

    - [ ] Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._
