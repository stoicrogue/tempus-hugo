## Vidrir - The Glamour Fades

> As Vidrir takes the reforged blade in his hands, the glade quiets. Light blooms from the blade. It reaches out with gentle insistence, like morning sun breaking mist.
> 
> Slowly, the air around Vidrir shimmers. His beard lengthens. His frame grows leaner and older, not frail—but timeless. His robes take on an archaic but elegant style. A single eye glimmers with ancient wisdom; the other is gone, covered by a simple eye patch.
> 
> Vidrir exhales, steady. “I suppose it’s time,” he says with quiet reverence. “Falsehood, even without malice, cannot stand in the light of Summer's Edge”.  The old sage smiles warmly as he gentle runs his finger along the back of the blade.  Still smiling but shaking his head, “No, there's nothing to forgive, bright one. I know it's just your nature. It does me well see you again.  …and in these chaotic times, we could use your strength and unwavering virtue.”
> 
> Vidrir turned back to the party and reverently handed the radiant blade back to Skreek. “Thank you for this opportunity to see my dear friend once more.  I'm sure you have questions”. He spread his hands and waited, as patient and calm as a mountain.
