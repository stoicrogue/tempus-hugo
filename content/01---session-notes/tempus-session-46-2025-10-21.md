## Vidrir - The Glamour Fades

> As [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) takes the reforged blade in his hands, the glade quiets. Light blooms from the blade. It reaches out with gentle insistence, like morning sun breaking mist.
> 
> Slowly, the air around [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) shimmers. His beard lengthens. His frame grows leaner and older, not frail—but timeless. His robes take on an archaic but elegant style. A single eye glimmers with ancient wisdom; the other is gone, covered by a simple eye patch.
> 
> [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) exhales, steady. “I suppose it’s time,” he says with quiet reverence. “Falsehood, even without malice, cannot stand in the light of Summer's Edge”.  The old sage smiles warmly as he gentle runs his finger along the back of the blade.  Still smiling but shaking his head, “No, there's nothing to forgive, bright one. I know it's just your nature. It does me well see you again.  …and in these chaotic times, we could use your strength and unwavering virtue.”
> 
> [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) turned back to the party and reverently handed the radiant blade back to [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek). “Thank you for this opportunity to see my dear friend once more.  I'm sure you have questions”. He spread his hands and waited, as patient and calm as a mountain.


# 📝 Session Notes

> **NOTE:** skipped golem encounter for pacing purposes
 
- Enjoyed breakfast at the Moonlit Hearth.  They bought gifts for [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) from [Seraphina](/02---characters/allies/seraphina-moonglow) before leaving: loose leaf tea and a bottle of mead.
- Used Leyline Gate Network to travel from [Spring Court](/06---factions/spring-court) to the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) Tomb
	- this is technically a mistake since the party never went back to the Tomb to attune their leyline gate ring after getting the ring from [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora). They would have needed to travel to one of the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court) standing stones and progress from there.
- Traveled by river from the Tomb to [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)’s grove using [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)’s folding boat.  It was an easy journey down river. Spotted a unique raven along the way.  [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) read its thoughts, which the raven allowed without resistance, learning that it was [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)’s familiar.  The raven told [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) he would inform his master of their approach.
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) appreciate the gifts and the chance to see Summer’s Edge once again.  
- “[Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) - The Glamour Fades” scene played out as planned.
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) revealed the name of his familiar that the party met is Huginn.
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) used his connection to Summer’s Edge to fully awaken it, giving it additional abilities, including bestowing limited truesight.
- Party traveled upriver to [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis), using [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)’s warhorse to pull the boat upstream.
- Visited Sig and Winry.  Sig gave [Toby](/02---characters/main-party/toby) the wrist blade he crafted for her.  Because he had extra time, he used a gem from the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) to give the blade the ability to inflict radiant damage. The extra time gave him the opportunity to practice his filigree work. He thusly referred to the blade as a “Dagger of Brightness”
