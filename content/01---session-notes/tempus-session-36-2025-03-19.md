    - Asthe party ascends the mountain, they reach a **high vantage point** where the Feywild mist parts, revealing a **dark, looming castle** in the valley below.

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

## The Weaver’s Castle – First Glimpse from the Mountain Peak

As the party reaches the mountain peak, the **golden light of the Feywild sun stretches endlessly above**, illuminating the world in an eternal, dreamlike noon. Below, the landscape unfolds in a cascade of shimmering forests, rolling hills, and rivers that glow with an otherworldly radiance.

But then… **they see it.**

Far in the distance, nestled in the **twisting valley of mist and shadow**, a structure looms—a **gothic castle, black as midnight**, standing in stark defiance of the vibrant world around it. Jagged spires pierce the sky like **twisted fangs**, and the air around it **warps subtly**, as if the place doesn’t quite belong in this plane of existence. A deep **chill crawls up your spine**, not from the air, but from something… **older. Watching. Waiting.**

The castle **wasn’t there a moment ago.** Or was it? **The longer you stare, the more certain you become that it’s always been there, lurking just out of sight.** The towers stretch unnaturally high, **higher than they should**, and the windows—massive, ornate things of blackened stained glass—**shift images when you aren’t looking directly at them.**

From this distance, **no signs of life stir. No smoke from chimneys. No movement on the parapets.** Yet somehow, you feel **unequivocally noticed.** As if something inside those walls has just turned its gaze toward you.

Then, the wind **shifts.** The golden light above flickers—**just for an instant**—and for the briefest moment, the castle appears… **closer.**

And then the wind moves on, and the illusion is gone.

But the castle?

The castle remains.

Waiting.

Watching.

**Calling.**

## Manus Scene

### Scene Setup

The party reaches the mountain peak, the **thin Feywild air humming with magic**. The sky above is **clear and golden**, the **Midday Sun** shining down on the device Elara Sunforge gave them. As they begin setting it up, shadows **lengthen unnaturally**—stretching like ink across the white stone beneath their feet. A low chuckle **echoes from nowhere**... then everywhere.

**Then, a figure steps out of the party’s own shadows**, a cocky grin on his face, twirling an **elemental blade crackling with energy** between his fingers.

### Manus' Opening Taunt

**Manus (grinning, arms spread wide)**

_"Awww, look at you. So determined. So hopeful. Setting up your little science fair project, thinking you're about to save the day. Honestly? It’s adorable."_

(He lazily steps around the device, inspecting it like it’s a **boring piece of furniture**.)

_"Gotta say, I’m a little disappointed. I was expecting something… **grander**. A big explosion, a dramatic ritual—maybe even a noble sacrifice? But no, it’s just… this._"

(He knocks on the side of the device with his knuckles.)

_"Kinda underwhelming, don’t you think?"_

### If the Party Demands He Leave

**Manus (mock gasp, placing a hand on his chest)**

_"Leave? Now? But we’re just getting started!"_

_"I mean, it’d be **so boring** if you just waltzed up here and got what you wanted, wouldn’t it? No struggle, no suffering, no heartbreak—just sunshine in a bottle? No, no, no, I can’t have that."_

_"See, I like my games **with a little more chaos.**"_

(He suddenly **snaps his fingers**, and **inky darkness floods the entire peak**, blotting out the sun.)

_"Oops. Looks like your precious **kiss of the sun** just got lost in the dark. Good luck finding it now."_

### If the Party Tries to Fight Him Immediately

**Manus (laughing as he dodges effortlessly, teleporting behind them)**

_"Ooooh, feisty! I like that! You think you can just punch your way out of this one? Adorable._

_"But let’s be real, even if you **could** hit me—which, spoiler alert, you can’t—_ (he dodges another attack effortlessly) _—I’m not here to kill you."_

_"I’m just here to **ruin your day.**"_

### If the Party Tries to Bargain

**Manus (mock thoughtful, tapping his chin)**

_"Oh, a deal? Interesting. Let me think about it… No."_

_"See, I’m not in this for **money, power, or some cultist's doomsday plan**. I’m in this for fun. And watching you struggle? That’s **very** fun."_

_"So here’s the game: Try to stop me before I snuff out your little sunbeam forever."_

(He conjures **two shadow copies**, each drawing **identical elemental blades**, their eyes glowing like embers in the darkness.)

_"Don’t worry, I’ll even let you keep breathing—**for now**."_

### If the Party Dispels the Darkness

(Manus **flinches** slightly as sunlight pierces through the shadows. He squints, then lets out a slow, amused whistle.)

**Manus (grinning)**

_"Well, well, well. Color me impressed. Didn’t think you had that in you."_

_"Guess I’ll have to step up my game next time."_

(He slowly **backs toward a shadow**, smirking.)

_"You’ve bought yourself a moment of sunshine. But I wouldn’t get too comfortable."_

_"After all… shadows always come back."_

(With that, he **vanishes into the darkness**, his laughter echoing as the last of the shadowy tendrils fade away.)
