## Chained Library Access

### The Ashen Shrine

> ‚ÄúThere are sanctioned gates. Places written in the margins of the world. The Ashen Shrine is one such place‚Äîa whisper of a path left open for those who do not wear the chains but have earned the Library‚Äôs regard. You would not have found it unless you were already being watched.‚Äù 
> *- Vael, Fifth Binder and Chainbearer of the Silent Vault*

- Atop a moss-laced clearing at the base of **Mount Vesithar**, surrounded by scorched trees that have since regrown with silver-veined bark. Faint leyline currents hum in the air.
- Half-buried in volcanic stone and time, the shrine is circular, with four broken plinths in a compass-like pattern‚Äîone for each season.
- Vines and ash cover its etched walls, which depict ancient Elven rites that predate the Courts themselves.
- In the center lies a flat, star-shaped platform with an **indentation shaped like a sword‚Äôs blade**‚Äînot a full socket, but more of a ceremonial resting groove.
	- When the reforged **Summer‚Äôs Edge** is laid in the groove, the shrine **awakens**‚Äîbut not with magic alone.
	- **A pulse of radiant warmth ripples outward**, and the sword begins to hum with an ancient chord of sunlight. The ash lifts into the air like it‚Äôs remembering the heat of the forge. Faint **whispers in Elvish** echo between the plinths, saying: _"He returns. The Blade of Light. The Guardian‚Äôs Promise.  We remember. We recognize. We release."_
- The plinths, responding to Summer‚Äôs Edge, glow faintly with their respective seasonal hues‚Äîeven if the party hasn‚Äôt gathered all tokens. **The sword‚Äôs presence alone serves as proof of purpose.**
- Then, with a deep grinding of earth and an exhale of long-trapped air, the star-shaped dais begins to descend‚Äîslowly, reverently‚Äîon a **platform of interlocking roots, obsidian, and starlight.**

### The Hollow Veins

- A vast underground chamber where magma once flowed but now pulses with planar magic and leyline energy.
- A **soulwrought bridge** (a bridge formed by sacrifice or memory) must be constructed to reach the sealed library doors.
- Echoes of failed seekers (spirits or memories) whisper warnings here.

### Final Seal: The Library‚Äôs Chains

- A massive **adamantine seal etched with runes and chains of radiant and shadow magic**.
- Cannot be opened by force or conventional magic.
- **Vael** offers the key‚Äîa phrase, ritual, or relic known only to the Chained Library‚Äôs agents.
- The seal unbinds in **reversed time**, as if the chains were never placed‚Äîrevealing a **spiral stair descending into black mist**.

# üìù Session Notes

- Previous session: long rest @ tree bordering the spring territory after closing the hollow threshold.  Slumpet attunes the leyline gate ring.
- Finish journey to the Spring Court, asking Vael about the court on the way.  He suggests visiting the Moonlit Hearth tavern and enjoying the tea.  Vael tells them the spring court is all about renewal, new beginnings, and acceptance.  He also tells them the leader of the court is the high druid, Faela Mossheart.
- The party visits the Moonlit Hearth and Seraphina Moonglow. Shad‚Äôs allergies start acting up and Seraphina gives him a cup of tea to cleanse him, curing his allergies.
- Toby offers one of her moonstones as barter for a round of drinks.  Seraphina is impressed and pours fruit wine and tea for the group.  Skreek takes up Seraphina on her offer to use her augury to answer a question: ‚Äúwill I find the royal artifact that was stolen from my people?‚Äù.  She answers that this he will have that chance soon.
- The party asks a guard where the standing stone for the court is and he points them to the royal garden behind the Head Druid‚Äôs residence.  Slumpet climbs the stone and attunes the leyline gate ring.
- The same guard escorts them in to see  the high druid.  Faela tells the party she hasn‚Äôt checked in on the temple in some time, but has noticed some odd activity in the forest of late.  She offers to escort them to the temple in the morning. Vael says he will investigate the forest near the court while the party visits the leyline temple.
- The party does a little shopping, including Skreek buying a cloak of billowing.  They then rest at the Moonlit Hearth for the night.
- Skreek summons a warhorse as his steed instead of a camel in the morning.  The party meets Faela in the garden and travel to the temple.  The journey is easy as the forest seems to open a path wherever Faela walks and wildflowers bloom in her footsteps. Along the way, when the party insinuates she needs protection because of her age, she uses her wildshape ability to become a saber tooth tiger and continues through the forest.
- The party arrives at the temple, finding the forest withering around the temple. Faela asks the party to plant magic seeds outside the temple as a promise each of them will make with themselves:
	- Shad - make the world better through music
	- Skreek - restore order  by retrieving the stole artifact of his people.
	- Toby - ‚ÄúWith this seed I do plant, may my bitterness wane. In the future, it shall grant, my companions and I less pain.‚Äù
	- Slumpet - vows the the dwarves will get what‚Äôs coming to them
- The seeds quickly sprout into beautiful flowers.  Only the flowers planted here seem to be growing normally.
- The temple itself is a massive willow tree that has grown around the temple‚Äôs entrance.  In the center of winding passages inside the tree, the party finds a staircase leading down.  The subsequent tunnel leads them to the leyline crystal chamber. The party investigates while Faela inspects the area outside to see if she can find the source of the corruption.
- As soon as they enter the chamber, everyone takes necrotic damage from an unknown source and they all back up.  Slumpet goes as gets Faela, telling her about what they found.  As Skreek enters the chamber again, he peers around and sees a creepy hooded figure, taking more necrotic damage when he locks eyes with it.
