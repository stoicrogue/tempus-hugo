### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

### Session Notes

- [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) shows up and questions the party
- Demands her crystal sphere back. The party denies the request, Slumpet throws the sphere out the window, and they try to leave. [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) magically slams the doors shut and attacks the party
- Shad tries to use the gate spell scroll to summon the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) but it doesn’t work
- Physical attacks are not proving to be very effective against the Hag while her claws seem formidable.
- In an act of desperation, Shad casts charm person on [serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity). It succeeds!?!
- The party begins talking to [serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) as she apologizes and begins making the party tea and breakfast.
- They acquire a journal [serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) dropped during the fight. Between the journal and the conversation with the charmed [serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity), the party learns she has been working with a spell caster named the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver).
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) specializes in fear and illusion magic. The party learns he was behind the tragedy of Shad’s village, where the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) conjured an illusion of a shadow dragon so convincing and fearsome that the villagers literally died of fright…
- The party slips out hoping to be miles away before the charm spell wears off.
- Slumpet takes the lead with the dark crystal in tow, trying to keep it away from [serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity), and heads towards the safety of [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)’s grove.
- Along the way Slumpet discovers that the flame skull corpses has revived itself. The party catches up and parlays with the skull named [Francis](/02---characters/allies/francis-the-flameskull). The skull agrees to forming a pact with the party, agreeing to show him adventures in exchange for his arcane knowledge.
