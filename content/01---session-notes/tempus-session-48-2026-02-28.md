# 📝 Session Notes

- Arrival
	- The party entered the ancient battlefield at night as the ritual was just beginning.  
	- The portal was 15ft in diameter when the party arrived, positioned near the base of the northern ruins.
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) was positioned in the ruined structured to the north. 
	- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) was positioned near the portal, keeping watch.
- Round 1
	- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) greeted the party, happy that they got his note and decided to come.  He taunted the party and fired a couple shots with his bow.
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) cast greater invisibility and used option b to advance the ritual slowly, causing a **secondary ring** of runes to appear around the portal: **fuzzy, unstable, ~5 ft larger in diameter** than the current stable portal.
	- The party carefully pushed north, trying to avoid the dark pools of water as much as possible.  They were difficult terrain and when the party glanced at the water, they saw horrific visions of war.
- Round 2
	- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) charges towards [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek), comments on his nice new sword, and attacks him with his pair of elemental blades
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) moved from his original location to confuse the party and advanced the ritual again, causing the fuzzy ring around the portal to **solidify** and the portal **expanded to fill the new space** (the portal is now larger and **stable/locked**). He also attempts to use the Suggestion spell on [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek), but it fails.
	- [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) cast a new spell, Dawn, causing a large circular area of the battlefield to become filled with daylight and inflicting radiant damage on any creature in the light.  This revealed the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s new position when he momentarily caught fire and took damage from the spell.
	- [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) positioned himself on the highest perch he could find (a ruined battlement) to give him visibility over the entire battlefield and a wall to hide behind
	- [Toby](/02---characters/main-party/toby) traded blows with [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus), trying to keep his attention focused on her.
	- [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) approached the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) after seeing his position thanks to [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)’s Dawn spell.  He attacked with Summer’s Edge and used Shining Smite to cause the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) to glow with radiant light, rendering his invisibility useless as long as [SKreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) could keep concentration on the spell.
- Round 3 + 4
	- [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) arrives, Moonblade drawn, and ready for battle on her unicorn. The epic battle hymn telepathically transmitted to all her allies
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) cast the Maze spell on [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek), banishing him to a demi plane, removing him from the battlefield.  [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) would need to investigate the maze to find a way to escape. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) also continued to advance the ritual and a new fuzzy edge formed around the portal. While [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) was in the maze, the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s invisibility started working again.
	- [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) dropped his Dawn spell to cast Confusion on [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus). The spell took hold and [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) was dazed for his entire next round, taking no actions.
	- The party continued to pressure the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) with as much damage as they could muster
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) lashed out with own Shadowweave bolt attacks, focusing on [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar).  He knocked [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) unconscious, breaking the spell that was dazing [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus). As [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) fell, a warm cocoon of divine light enveloped [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) and his body was raised, as if by invisible strings, to a standing position.  He eyes opened and his wounds partially healed as he heard the Aribiter’s voice in his head: “You are still needed her, my champion…”.
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), obviously pressured and frustrated, yelled to [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus): “What am I paying you for! This is what we’ve been working towards for so long.  It’s time to get serious and earn your keep!”.  [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) relented, but said dismissively “Fine, but I’m not sure this ritual is really going to be worth it.”.  The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) advanced the ritual again and the new fuzzy edge solidified, making the stable portal increase in size again, now 10 feet wider than it was when the ritual started.
	- Summer’s Edge helped [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) get out of the maze, drawing from its own experience with banishment spells in the past, and return to the battle. 
- Round 5 + 6
	- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) finally summoned two of his shadow clones and used them to tie up multiple party members.
	- The battle continued this way for two rounds, each side dealing significant damage.  [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) and [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) used divine magic to heal them selves and their allies to keep them in the fight.
	- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) advanced the ritual yet again, forming a new fuzzy ring around the portal.
	- [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) tried attacking the portal after seeing one of [Francis](/02---characters/allies/francis-the-flameskull)’ errant fire rays graze the portal and seem to disrupt it slightly. [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)’s attacks seemed to be having an effect on the portal, but the fuzzy edge remained.
	- After taking significant damage and seeing his goals slipping away, became desperate.  He gathered magical energy to his fist and slammed the ground.  Reality seemed to rupture around the blow and a shockwave of force slammed into everyone nearby, dealing a decent chunk of damage.
	- Seeing this, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) became enraged and screamed at the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver): “this is too far, I didn’t sign up for this!”.  [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) seemed poised to turn against the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver).
	- [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) was too far away from the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) to bring her blade to bear, so she cast Moonbeam.  A silvery pillar of moonlight slammed down from the heavens and impacted the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver).  It nearly sliced him in half like a laser and his body fell to the ground, cold and unmoving.  The party won the day and made sure [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) could not return to the realm this day.
