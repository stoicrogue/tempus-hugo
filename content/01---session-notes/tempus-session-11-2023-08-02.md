### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._
