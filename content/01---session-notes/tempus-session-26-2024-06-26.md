### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

### Session Notes

> Test of Compassion: The Wounded Creature
> 
> ### Encounter Setup
> 
> - **Location:** The party enters a sacred grove where the Forest Guardian, a powerful **Treant**, resides. The grove is filled with ancient trees, vibrant flora, and a sense of profound peace.
> - **Description:** The Treant appears before the party, its eyes glowing with ancient wisdom. It speaks in a deep, resonant voice that echoes through the grove.
> 
> **Treant's Challenge:**
> 
> - The Treant explains that the grove is home to many creatures, and it values those who show kindness and compassion. To prove their worthiness, the party must help a wounded creature within the grove.
> 
> **The Test:**
> 
> 1. **The Wounded Creature:**
>     - The party is led to a small clearing where they find a **wounded fey creature**, such as a **Sprite** or a **Baby Unicorn**. The creature is in pain and unable to move, with a thorny, poisonous vine wrapped around its leg, causing severe injury.
> 2. **Healing and Protection:**
>     - The party must use their skills and resources to heal the creature. This could involve using healing spells, applying herbal remedies, or carefully removing the thorny vine without causing further harm.
> 3. **Overcoming Obstacles:**
>     - During the process, the party faces additional challenges:
>         - **Aggressive Wildlife:** Predatory creatures, drawn by the scent of blood, threaten the wounded fey creature. The party must protect it from these threats without killing the wildlife, demonstrating their ability to preserve life.
>         - **Nature's Wrath:** The grove's natural defenses react to the disturbance, causing thorny vines to lash out or roots to entangle the party. They must navigate these obstacles with care and respect for the forest.
> 
> **Conclusion:**
> 
> - **Success:** If the party successfully heals and protects the wounded creature, the Treant acknowledges their compassion and grants them a boon. This could be a **Blessing of the Forest** (temporary buffs such as enhanced healing, resistance to poison, or advantage on nature-related checks) and valuable information or guidance for their journey.
> - **Failure:** If the party fails to show compassion or acts recklessly, the Treant may withhold its blessing and assistance, urging the party to reflect on the importance of empathy and respect for all living beings.
> 
> ### Role-Playing Opportunities
> 
> - Encourage the party to engage in role-playing during the encounter, expressing their care and concern for the wounded creature and discussing how they will approach the task.
> - Provide opportunities for individual characters to shine by using their unique skills, such as a healer’s medical knowledge, a druid’s connection to nature, or a bard’s soothing words.
> 
> This test of compassion emphasizes the importance of empathy and kindness, adding depth to the encounter and reinforcing the values held by the Forest Guardian and the elven grove.
