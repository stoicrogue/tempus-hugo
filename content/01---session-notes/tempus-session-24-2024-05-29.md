# Strong Start

- [x] The entrance to the Court of Autumn is marked by a serene river crossing. The river itself is calm and tranquil, its waters gently flowing under the vibrant shades of changing leaves. Standing majestically at the edge of the river is a grand [Torii](https://nerdnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC01134.jpg) gate. With its elegant design and beautifully crafted architecture, the gate symbolizes the transition from the mortal world to the sacred realm of the Autumn Court. The sight of the Torii gate against the backdrop of the Autumn hues is a breathtaking spectacle, capturing the essence of the season in its full glory. You notice another standing stone on a small outcropping slightly to the north of the gate.

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._
