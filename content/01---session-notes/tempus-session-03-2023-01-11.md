### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

### Darkness event at Tannis kickoff

> Without warning, the villagers woke up to screams and panic. Complete darkness shrouded their entire village. No light could illuminate more than twenty feet in any direction. And then came the monsters. No one knows how many people are still alive, and it’s impossible to count the sheer amount of screams that eventually go quiet. In the wake of this panic, you have all found yourselves in Bastian’s Windmill. It seems to be the safest place to catch your breath and figure out what is going on and what to do… for now…
