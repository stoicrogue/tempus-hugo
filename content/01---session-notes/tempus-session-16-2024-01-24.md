### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

## Scratchpad

_Jot down notes during your game. Use it for a text-based combat tracker or anything else. Copy and paste from here into Discord for example. Here's more on [playing D&D and Discord](https://slyflourish.com/playing_dnd_over_discord.html) and a [Markdown-based battle map](https://slyflourish.com/text-based_battle_maps.html)._

### Session Notes

- Late October
- The party agreed to track the Bandersnatch and try to retrieve some of its venom.
- Gathered supplies to make traps to lure the creature
- Successfully tracked the creature based on where Olivia had been hunting the day she was attacked.
- [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) employed his squirrel network again to help alert him to the creature
- [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) set up traps with the bait they gathered (meat and catnip)
- The traps worked and attracted the creature
- The party was able to kill it, but struggled to deal with the creature’s poison claws and gas
- They chopped off its head for good measure and brought it back to the Winter Embassy
