DM prep notes for each session of the Tempus campaign, from our first session in November 2022 through Session 47 in January 2026. These notes evolved significantly over three years as I figured out what worked best for me at the table.

**Early sessions** used a loose, experimental format while I ran off my iPad. **Middle sessions** adopted the Lazy Dungeon Master template (Strong Start, Scenes, Secrets & Clues, NPCs, Monsters) and I switched to printed notes to stay more present at the table. **Later sessions** became more elaborate with detailed stat blocks, Cold Open prose, and d12 encounter tables -- more prep in service of better improvisation.
