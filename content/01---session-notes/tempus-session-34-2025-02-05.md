### Displacer Beast

**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 85 (10d10 + 30) **Speed** 40 ft.

|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|18 (+4)|15 (+2)|16 (+3)|6 (-2)|12 (+1)|8 (-1)|

- **Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
- **Avoidance.**_ If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Displacement.**_ The displacer beast projects a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer beast is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.

 #### Actions
- **Multiattack.**_ The displacer beast makes two attacks with its tentacles.
_**Tentacle.** 
  - Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
  - Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage.

  
### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

## Shimmering Glade

You step into a secluded glade where the forest's canopy parts slightly, allowing golden sunlight to spill into the clearing. The boundary between the Material Plane and the Feywild feels paper-thin here, the air humming softly with latent magic. The glade is filled with shimmering light that seems to dance on its own, and the faint smell of wildflowers and ozone hangs in the air.

At the center of the glade, a circle of ancient, moss-covered standing stones rises from the ground, each embedded with small crystal shards that faintly glow. The crystals pulse gently, as if waiting for something—perhaps the sun itself—to awaken them. It is clear that when the sun reaches its peak at noon, the light will strike the crystals, activating the crossing.

However, a large **displacer beast** lies curled in the middle of the stone circle, its sleek, black form rising and falling with slow, rhythmic breaths. As you step closer, you notice small movements in the underbrush: two **displacer beast cubs** frolic nearby, tumbling over one another and occasionally batting at the edge of the stones. The glade is tranquil, but a wrong move could turn this peaceful scene into chaos.

---

### **Challenge: Clearing the Glade**

- The displacer beast is napping, but it will awaken if disturbed by loud noises, hostile actions, or if its cubs yelp in distress. If combat breaks out, the mother beast will fight ferociously to protect its territory and her cubs.
- The cubs are playful and curious, occasionally swatting at the crystals embedded in the stones. If the crystals are dislodged or knocked out of place, the portal activation process may be delayed until the party realigns them.

---

### Complication 1: Displacer Beast Cubs

- The **displacer beast cubs** are unaware of the danger they might cause. They are playful and unpredictable, and their actions might inadvertently complicate the party’s task.
    - A cub playfully bats at one of the standing stones, knocking a crystal out of alignment. The party will need to carefully replace it without angering the mother beast.
    - A cub notices a party member and wanders over curiously, sniffing or pawing at their belongings. Any sudden movements or loud reactions could alert the mother beast.
    - If combat breaks out, the cubs will scatter and hide, but their cries will enrage the mother, causing her to fight more recklessly.
    - **Handling the Cubs:**
        - The party could use Animal Handling checks (DC 14) to calm or distract the cubs, keeping them occupied while they work on activating the portal

---

### Complication 2: Wild Magic Infusion

The glade is so infused with Feywild magic that every spell cast here has unpredictable effects. Any time a spell is cast, roll on the **Wild Magic Surge** table (PHB p. 104) to determine the outcome. The party will need to think carefully before using spells, as the surges could complicate or even help the situation.

---

### Activating the Portal

- To open the crossing to the Feywild, the party must ensure the crystals embedded in the standing stones are properly aligned and undisturbed.
    - This requires a **group skill challenge**, with a mix of Investigation (to identify proper alignments), Arcana (to adjust the crystals for maximum magical effect), and Dexterity or Strength checks (to physically move or replace the crystals).
    - The party must succeed on a total of **4 skill checks (DC 14)** before the sun reaches its peak at noon.
- If the crystals are knocked out of alignment by the displacer beast, the cubs, or a wild magic surge, the party must spend an additional turn realigning them.

---

### Displacer Beast Combat (If Necessary):

If combat breaks out, the mother displacer beast will attack anyone who threatens her or her cubs. Her tactics are protective and territorial, not cruel—she focuses on driving the party away rather than killing them outright.

**Displacer Beast Tactics:**

- Uses **Displacement** to confuse attackers, making it harder for the party to land hits.
- Will attempt to block access to her cubs or the standing stones, forcing the party to work around her.
- Fights until reduced to 25% health, at which point she attempts to grab her cubs and retreat into the forest.

---

### Outcome:

1. **Success:** If the party successfully aligns the crystals and activates the portal, the standing stones glow brightly, and a shimmering, circular portal appears at the center of the circle. The mother beast retreats with her cubs, as the magic overwhelms her instincts.
    - _"The crystals pulse with radiant energy, each shard capturing the midday sunlight and refracting it into a dazzling array of colors. The air hums with power as the standing stones vibrate, and a portal of shimmering light blossoms in the center of the glade, its edges rippling like a pool of liquid gold. You feel the pull of the Feywild, beckoning you forward."_
2. **Failure:** If the party is unable to align the crystals or is driven off by the displacer beast, the portal does not activate. They may need to retreat and return later, or seek another crossing into the Feywild.
3. **Compromised Success:** If the portal is activated but the wild magic or combat leaves the party injured or disorganized, the portal may open to an unstable part of the Feywild, adding complications when they arrive.

## Feast with a Satyr Warband

As the party travels through the Fey Wild, they come across a wild, raucous gathering in a forest clearing. Dozens of satyrs are dancing, playing music, and feasting on fruits, nuts, and wine. The air is filled with the sound of laughter, pipes, and revelry.

When the party approaches, the satyrs immediately take notice and welcome them enthusiastically. "Adventurers! Come, join our celebration! The night is young and the wine flows freely!" one of the satyrs calls out, gesturing for the party to come closer.

The satyrs are excellent hosts, offering the party a seat at their table laden with delicacies and goblets brimming with a sweet, intoxicating vintage. They encourage the party to eat, drink, and be merry, assuring them that this is a night for indulgence and enjoyment.

However, the party may quickly realize that the satyrs' revelry and hospitality come with a price. The wine's effects are more potent than expected, and the music has a hypnotic quality that makes it difficult to resist the urge to dance. A successful Wisdom saving throw may be required to avoid becoming charmed or intoxicated.

Furthermore, the satyrs may subtly (or not-so-subtly) try to manipulate the party, perhaps asking them to perform some mischievous task or make a "harmless" pact in exchange for more wine, food, or magical trinkets. The party must navigate the satyrs' cajoling and temptations carefully, as giving in could lead to unforeseen consequences.

### Drinking Contest

The satyrs challenge the party to a drinking contest, promising the winner a rare magical item. However, the wine is laced with fey magic, and the loser(s) may be subjected to a debilitating curse or transformation.

- The Fool's Tongue: The loser can only speak in rhymes and riddles for the next 7 days, making normal conversation difficult and spellcasting with verbal components challenging
- The Dancing Feet: Every time the loser hears music, they must succeed on a Wisdom save or dance uncontrollably for 1 minute
- The Laughing Curse: The loser bursts into uncontrollable laughter at the most inappropriate moments (during stealth, negotiations, etc.)
- Temporary transformation into a satyr themselves, complete with goat legs and an irresistible urge to play music
- The loser's hair turns into flowering vines that grow rapidly when they lie or break a promise
- Every time they try to drink anything, it turns into butterflies just before reaching their lips

### Bargain for Merriment

A satyr offers to grant the party a single night of pure, unbridled joy and celebration in exchange for a future favor.

- "Simply deliver this sealed letter to the Winter Court. Don't worry about what's inside..."
- "Help us play a harmless prank on a rival pixie court by switching their magical mushrooms with our special batch"
- "When you hear the sound of pipes at midnight three days hence, you must dance until dawn, no matter where you are"
- "Promise to tell three carefully crafted lies to the next noble you meet"
- "Plant these 'special' seeds in the garden of the nearest human settlement"
- "The next time you see someone crying, you must make them laugh - no matter what it takes"
- "Trade your most cherished memory for a new one of our choosing"
- "You must host a feast as wild as ours within the next month, and ensure at least one attendee never leaves"

## Weakening Barrier Encounters

|d12|Encounter Description|
|---|---|
|1|**Feywild Bloom:** The forest ahead shimmers as vibrant flowers and trees from the Feywild spontaneously sprout. A group of **pixies** are playing tricks, trying to lead the party astray. The party must either appease the pixies with a gift or pass a Charisma (Persuasion) check to be allowed safe passage. If angered, the pixies may cast confusing illusions.|
|2|**Shadowfall Tears:** The air grows cold and the forest dims as a rift to the Shadowfell opens nearby. Emerging from the tear are **2 shadow demons** and **3 wraiths** hunting for life energy. These creatures pursue the party, aiming to drain their vitality. The party may choose to confront the creatures or flee, as closing the rift requires quick thinking or magical means.|
|3|**Unstable Magic:** A wild magic surge ripples through the forest. The party stumbles upon an area where magic behaves unpredictably. Any spell cast within a 30-foot radius requires a roll on the **Wild Magic Surge** table (PHB p. 104). This zone is unstable, and creatures entering it must also make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) to resist temporary confusion.|
|4|**Elven Refugees:** A group of elven refugees from the Summer Court is fleeing the forest’s instability. They carry valuable information about the cult’s movements and could offer aid in exchange for help reaching safety. However, they are being stalked by a **shadow mastiff** pack, and the party must either defeat the hounds or protect the elves while they escape.|
|5|**Rogue Fey Beasts:** Fey creatures from the Feywild, such as **2 eladrin archers** and their trained **dire elk**, have become corrupted by leyline magic. These once noble beings now attack anything that moves, mistaking the party for intruders. They are hostile but could be reasoned with through a difficult Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.|
|6|**Blighted Grove:** The trees in this part of the forest have withered and blackened, and a dark pool of stagnant water dominates the area. The party is confronted by a **blight** infestation (1 shambling mound, 2 vine blights, 3 twig blights). The shambling mound has been affected by the weakening leyline magic and possesses strange fey-like abilities, such as teleporting through the trees.|
|7|**Fey Court Messenger:** A **Summer Eladrin** on horseback, sent by the Summer Court, approaches the party with a cryptic message: “The forest’s heart bleeds. Time grows short. Restore balance, or all shall be lost to shadow and fire.” The eladrin vanishes after delivering the message. This encounter may give the party insight into how to stabilize the leyline.|
|8|**Solar Elemental Surge:** A surge of unstable magic awakens a **fire elemental** and **2 radiant sprites** near the Summer Court's leyline temple. The elemental has been corrupted and now burns uncontrollably, threatening to spread through the surrounding forest. The party can either contain the flames (via water spells or natural means) or engage in combat to quell the elemental’s fury.|
|9|**Haunted Ruins:** The party discovers ancient elven ruins, now haunted by **4 specters** and **1 banshee**. These spirits were once temple guards, but the leyline damage has bound them to the ruins. They may attempt to communicate with the party if a ritual of peace is performed, offering clues about the leyline’s original purpose.|
|10|**Fey Ambush: Quicklings** and **darklings** aligned with the Cult of the Eclipse ambush the party as they travel. These creatures attempt to steal the party’s valuables, particularly any magical items or leyline-related artifacts they carry. The quicklings use their speed to dart in and out of combat, while the darklings strike from the shadows.|
|11|**Sunfire Tree Guardians:** A grove of ancient, golden trees begins to glow with intense light as **2 awakened trees** and **4 dryads** rise to protect the forest. They are suspicious of outsiders, believing the party may be the source of the forest’s instability. Through a Wisdom (Insight) check, the party can convince them of their good intentions or be forced to defend themselves.|
|12|**Cult Scout:** The party encounters a **lone scout from the Cult of the Eclipse**, hiding in the trees and observing them from afar. The scout may attempt to lure the party into a trap or retreat to inform his superiors. If captured, the scout can be interrogated to reveal the cult’s next move in the forest. Alternatively, he could offer a bribe to be released.|
