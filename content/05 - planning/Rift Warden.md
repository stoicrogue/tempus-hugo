> [!tip] Rift Warden 
> The Warden of the Rift is a role born out of necessity—someone who must remain at the fracture point between the Shadowfell and the Material Plane to ensure the seal holds. It’s not a title anyone seeks, but one that's accepted in a moment of profound sacrifice.

## Origin

Long ago, when Nidhogg was first sealed, it wasn’t enough to just close the rift. A guardian had to stay behind, bound to the place, to become part of the lock. That original Warden may have been a member of the Order of Seasons, possibly even Vidrir himself—explaining his strange age and fading memory. Or perhaps the Weaver was once destined to be the Warden… and ran from it.

## Role and Power

The Warden gains tremendous magical awareness and control over the boundary between realms. They can sense breaches, influence the borderlands, and anchor the leyline energies that fuel the rift’s stability. But this power comes at a price:

Isolation: The Warden cannot leave the Rift. Doing so weakens the seal.

Transformation: Over time, they may start to reflect the place they guard—becoming spectral, ageless, or something stranger.

Temptation: Nidhogg whispers constantly. Not just to break free—but to offer the Warden dominion in exchange for release.

## Dramatic Potential

If one of your players steps into this role, it could be an incredible epilogue or bittersweet ending—especially if that character has always struggled with identity, power, or redemption. Alternatively, maybe they don’t accept it… and the world pays a price.
