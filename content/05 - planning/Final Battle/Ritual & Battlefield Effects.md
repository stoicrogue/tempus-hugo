# Battlefield & Lair Effects - The Final Ritual

## Initiative Count 20 - Lair Actions
*Roll 1d3 to determine which effect occurs, or choose based on tactical needs*

### Phase 1-2 Effects
1. **Shifting Shadows** - All shadows in the area move 15 feet in a direction of your choice. Any creature ending its turn in a shadow takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

2. **Disorienting Echoes** - Ghostly whispers fill the air. All creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or have disadvantage on their next attack roll and ability check.

3. **Unstable Ground** - Choose a 20-foot radius area. The ground becomes difficult terrain and creatures starting their turn there must make a DC 14 Dexterity save or fall prone.

### Phase 3-4 Effects  
1. **Portal Magnetism** - All creatures within 60 feet of the portal must make a DC 16 Strength save or be pulled 15 feet toward it. Creatures pulled into the portal take 2d8 force damage.

2. **Reality Fracture** - Choose a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area must make a DC 17 Intelligence save or be stunned until the end of their next turn as reality warps around them.

3. **Nidhogg's Whispers** - All creatures hear the shadow dragon's voice. Make a DC 16 Charisma save or be charmed by the Weaver until the end of your next turn.

### Phase 5+ Effects
1. **Shadowfell Bleed** - A 40-foot radius area becomes heavily obscured by writhing shadows. Creatures starting their turn in the area take 2d6 necrotic damage.

2. **Planar Rift** - Roll on Wild Magic Surge table (or create custom chaotic effects) as reality becomes increasingly unstable.

3. **Dragon's Presence** - All creatures within 100 feet must make a DC 18 Wisdom save or be frightened for 1 minute. Frightened creatures cannot willingly move closer to the portal.

## Battlefield Features & Hazards

### Environmental Conditions (Escalating)

**Phase 1-2: Gathering Shadows**
- Light sources dimmed by one category
- Temperature drops by 20°F
- Mirrors and reflective surfaces show disturbing alternate realities
- Animal sounds from the forest go silent

**Phase 3-4: Shadowfell Influence**  
- All creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
- Undead and shadow creatures have advantage on attack rolls
- Magic items flicker and temporarily lose properties (1 round, DM's choice)
- Gravitational anomalies: some areas have reduced/increased gravity

**Phase 5+: Reality Breakdown**
- Teleportation magic is unreliable (50% chance to arrive 1d4×5 feet from intended destination)
- Time dilation: some creatures act as if under *slow* or *haste* randomly
- Solid surfaces occasionally become permeable for 1 round
- Past battles echo as ghostly images overlap current fight

### Dynamic Terrain Changes

**Round 1:** Ancient ritual circle begins to glow with eldritch energy

**Round 2:** Cracks appear in stone structures; some provide new cover, others create difficult terrain  

**Round 3:** Water features turn black and begin to bubble; treat as difficult terrain that deals 1d4 necrotic damage

**Round 4:** Portal energy causes some elevated platforms to float 10 feet higher

**Round 5:** Shadowfell corruption spreads - plants wither, stone crumbles, metal rusts rapidly

**Round 6+:** Gravity wells appear randomly; creatures within 20 feet pulled toward center (DC 15 Str save)

## Specific Hazard Areas (Reference Map)

### A. Central Ritual Circle
- **Phase 1-2:** Difficult terrain, Weaver gains +2 AC while inside
- **Phase 3+:** Portal forms here; creatures within 10 feet take 1d6 necrotic damage per turn
- **Destruction:** Requires 3 successful DC 20 Arcana checks (action) or 50+ damage to disruption

### B. Ancient Stone Platforms  
- **Phase 1:** Provide high ground (+1 to ranged attacks)
- **Phase 2:** Some begin to levitate, creating aerial combat opportunities
- **Phase 3+:** Become unstable; DC 15 Acrobatics to avoid falling when moving

### C. Dark Water Pools
- **Phase 1:** Reflect false images (minor illusion effects)
- **Phase 2:** Become portals for shadow creatures to emerge
- **Phase 3+:** Anyone touching water must make DC 16 Wis save or be stunned by visions

## Special Battlefield Events

### Random Events (Roll d6 each round after Round 3)
1. **Echo of the Past:** Ghostly knights from the Order of Seasons appear and fight shadows for 1 round
2. **Temporal Hiccup:** One random creature gets an extra turn immediately  
3. **Shadow Clone:** One character's shadow becomes hostile and attacks them
4. **Planar Overlap:** Part of the Feywild bleeds through, creating wild magic zone
5. **Dragon's Roar:** Everyone makes DC 16 Con save or deafened and 1d8 thunder damage
6. **Reality Anchor:** Small area (20 ft radius) becomes immune to illusions and planar effects

### Critical Moments
**If Weaver reaches 25% HP:** "If I cannot have victory, none shall have peace!" - attempts to collapse reality around the battlefield

**If Portal reaches 75% completion:** Nidhogg's shadow becomes visible through the portal, all creatures make DC 18 Wis save or frightened

**If any PC is pulled into portal:** They experience brief glimpse of Shadowfell before being expelled (taking 4d8 necrotic damage but gaining advantage on saves vs fear for rest of encounter)

## Victory/Failure Escalation

### Near Victory (Weaver below 50% HP, ritual interrupted)
- Weaver becomes desperate, reality warps more severely
- Manus may switch sides: "This madness goes too far!"
- Environmental effects occur twice per round

### Near Failure (Portal >90% complete)
- Nidhogg begins pulling everything into Shadowfell
- All creatures within 120 feet: DC 20 Strength save each turn or pulled 30 feet toward portal
- If anyone enters portal at this stage, they're trapped in Shadowfell (major campaign consequence)

### Dramatic Finish Options
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Portal damaged but not closed, ongoing campaign consequences
- **Heroic Sacrifice:** A PC or important NPC may need to sacrifice themselves to seal the portal
- **Unexpected Ally:** Manus turns against Weaver at crucial moment
- **Divine Intervention:** Arbiter or other divine force provides crucial assistance
