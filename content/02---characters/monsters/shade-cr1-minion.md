**Incorporeal Movement.** The shade can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The shade is destroyed if they end their turn inside an object.

**Minion.** If the shade takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0. If the shade takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise, they take no damage.

**Terrifying.** If an enemy starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more shades, the enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the shades until the start of their next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 10 plus the number of shades within 5 feet of the enemy. On a successful save, the enemy is immune to the Terrifying trait of all shades for the next 24 hours.
