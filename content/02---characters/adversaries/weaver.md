# The Weaver

- Chaotic evil elf wizard and master illusionist who leads the **[Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)**
- Responsible for the tragedy of [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s village — he conjured an illusion of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) so convincing and fearsome that the villagers literally **died of fright**
- His stronghold is a tower in the Feywild, hidden behind a **Mirage Arcane** spell that makes it appear balanced on a spire at the center of a massive sinkhole — unreachable
- Originally not interested in freeing [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) — he thought the dragon's image would make for a "fantastic illusion" — but his ambitions grew to unraveling the barrier entirely
- An 18th-level spellcaster (spell save DC 19) with mastery over illusion magic; his illusion spells function as one level higher than the slot used
- Willing to work with [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) and other agents to further his experiments and cult operations

## Philosophy & Motivation

- Driven by the conviction that reality itself is malleable — through illusion, he can reshape truth and domination
- Believes the leyline barrier imprisoning [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) is a "false light" born from fear, and that the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) blindly tend "a crumbling dam without questioning why the waters rise"
- Views the world through the metaphor of a loom — everything is threads that can be woven, unraveled, or re-threaded
- His journal documents his evolution from illusionist prodigy to would-be world-shaper: discovering that fear is more powerful than substance, that belief shapes reality, and that "there is no truth but what I weave"
- Fascination with fear is not merely tactical — it is his ultimate expression of power

## The Destruction of Shadicar's Village

- Created an illusion of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) so horrifyingly realistic that [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s entire village died of terror
- When interrogated via Speak with Dead, [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) confirmed the Weaver did this "for amusement"
- This atrocity is the emotional anchor of [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s personal vendetta against the Weaver
- Proved his philosophy that belief shapes reality — an image alone killed an entire community

## Cult of the Eclipse

- Leads the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse), which seeks to free [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) by corrupting the leyline temples
- Taught [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) the curse ritual she used on the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis)
- Created **Hollow Thresholds** — tears in reality that siphon leyline power and weaken the barrier while pulling shadow creatures into the Material Plane
- His intercepted letter to [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker) confirmed the strategy: "The Shadow Dragon's freedom hinges on the weakening of the barrier"
- Key subordinates:
  - **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)** (Night Hag) — field agent who cursed [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis); **defeated by the party**
  - **[Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker)** (Black Dragonborn Sorcerer) — herald who proclaimed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s return at the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court) festival; **defeated by the party**
  - **[Kharvex, the Shadow Caller](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller)** — cult mage who tested summoning magic at the ancient battlefield; **defeated by the party**
  - **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)** (CR 17 Shapechanger) — enigmatic warrior who openly mocks the Weaver and appears motivated by testing himself rather than ideology; stole the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s leyline crystal and planted the Bodak in the Spring Temple; **still at large**

## The Leyline Barrier Plot

- The interplanar barrier imprisoning [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) is anchored by **four seasonal leyline temples** — one in each court (Winter, Autumn, Summer, Spring)
- The Weaver's strategy is to systematically damage or corrupt these temples to weaken the entire barrier
- Leyline temple status as discovered by the party:
  - **Winter:** One of six focus crystals cracked and flickering
  - **Summer:** Breached; two guardian constructs destroyed; one rune crystal stolen by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)
  - **Spring:** Most heavily corrupted; Bodak planted in crystal chamber; multiple Hollow Thresholds siphoning power nearby
  - **Autumn:** Intact and stable (the only undamaged temple)
- Accelerated his timeline — moved the final ritual to the next new moon rather than waiting for the winter solstice

## The Final Ritual

- Plans to execute his summoning ritual at the **ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed** centuries ago
- The ritual tears open a portal to the Shadowfell, progressing through phases:
  - **Phase 1-2:** Gathering power, portal forming
  - **Phase 3:** [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) approaches — his whispers can charm creatures, his presence radiates fear
  - **Phase 4:** Breakthrough imminent — [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s shadow becomes visible through the portal
- During the ritual, he maintains concentration and gains resistance to non-magical weapons — but cannot flee effectively, making him a stationary target
- If the ritual completes, [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) would be freed and eternal darkness would reign

## The Weaver's Journal

- His journal, called **"Silmirien"** (silmi = gleam/light, rien = woven), chronicles his evolution from illusionist to world-shaper
- Contains his true name written in invisible ink, visible only under moonlight, in an elven script that "almost sings itself into the night air"
- Speaking his name aloud activates a recorded message bound into the journal
- The journal is tethered to his soul — if burned, the smoke will call him home, suggesting deep paranoia about being unmade or forgotten

## Ancestral Home

- Before his Feywild tower, maintained an elegant elven castle now fallen into ruin
- The castle became infused with his magic — mirrors that forced visitors to confront personal fears, an Echo of his own soul bound to the throne room
- Contains a hidden underground chamber with an obsidian standing stone and dormant teleportation circle older than the castle itself
- A garden of **"Living Echoes"** — plants and pathways suffused with fading illusion magic showing visions of regret and the Weaver at his loom

## Vulnerabilities

- **Vulnerability to Truth:** When affected by True Sight or divination magic, he loses his damage resistances and has disadvantage on spell attack rolls
- **Summer's Edge** (the legendary blade reforged by the party) can target him through any illusion as if he were visible
- **Ritual Dependency:** Must maintain concentration during the summoning — stationary and exposed
- **True Name:** Speaking it aloud may reveal his location or create a magical connection the party can exploit
- **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)'s Disloyalty:** His lieutenant openly mocks him and may not defend the ritual
