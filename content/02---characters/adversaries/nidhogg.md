# Nidhogg

- Ancient shadow dragon sealed in the **Shadowfell** by the **[Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons)** during a great war centuries ago
- Led **undead legions** that threatened to drown the Feywild in shadow before he was bound
- Hates the **Dusk Lord** and anyone marked by the Dusk Lord or the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)
- His imprisonment is maintained by two forces: the **elven leyline barrier** (the cage) and **[Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)'s divine power** woven into it (the lock)
- Cannot be easily destroyed — even gods cannot readily unmake an ancient shadow dragon
- Described as ancient, cunning, and was at the height of his power when sealed
## The Seal

- The barrier is anchored by **four leyline temples**, one in each seasonal domain of the Fey Courts (Winter, Autumn, Summer, Spring)
- [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir) (Odin in disguise) wove a portion of his divine essence into the barrier — his power has been actively maintaining the seal for centuries
- As the leyline barrier weakens, more weight falls on [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)'s shoulders
- If the seal breaks, Nidhogg escapes with centuries of rage, cult allies, and the power to spread darkness across multiple realms

## Cult of the Eclipse

- The [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) serves Nidhogg's goals, seeking to free him by corrupting the leyline temples
- [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) (night hag) cursed the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) to earn Nidhogg's favor, communing with him through a **seeing stone** (crystal orb)
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) leads the cult and plans to weaken the leyline network to release Nidhogg — though his original interest was in using Nidhogg's image for his illusions, not serving the dragon directly
- [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker) publicly proclaimed Nidhogg's return at the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court) festival
- The cult created **Hollow Thresholds** — tears in reality that siphon leyline power and weaken the barrier

## The Weaver's Illusion

- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) conjured an illusion of Nidhogg so convincing and fearsome that the villagers of [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s village literally **died of fright**
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) was not originally interested in freeing Nidhogg — he thought the dragon's image would make for a "fantastic illusion" — but his ambitions grew to unraveling the barrier entirely

## The Final Ritual

- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) plans to execute his summoning ritual at the **ancient battlefield where Nidhogg was sealed** ages ago
- The ritual tears open a portal to the Shadowfell, progressing through phases:
  - **Phase 1-2:** Gathering power, portal forming
  - **Phase 3:** Nidhogg approaches — his whispers can charm creatures, his presence radiates fear
  - **Phase 4:** Breakthrough imminent — Nidhogg's shadow becomes visible through the portal; all creatures must resist or be frightened and paralyzed
- If the ritual completes, Nidhogg would be freed and eternal darkness would reign

## Historical Context

- Lord Farkris of the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court) **regretted failing to make peace** with Nidhogg centuries ago
- The [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) — founded by [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)/Odin — were the guardians who fought Nidhogg's forces. Most of them died buying time for the seal to be completed
- The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) was not involved in the original sealing but recognizes Nidhogg as an enemy of the Dusk Lord
- Nidhogg may sense [Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)'s essence in the seal, but the Shadowfell separates them — he cannot reach through the barrier... yet
