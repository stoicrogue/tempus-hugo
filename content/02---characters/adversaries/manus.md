# Manus

- Enigmatic **CR 17 shapechanger** and trickster warrior loosely allied with the **[Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)**
- Serves the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) as a lieutenant but openly **mocks his ideology** and appears motivated by testing himself against worthy opponents rather than freeing [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)
- Possesses **Advanced Shapechanger** abilities — can perfectly mimic other humanoids, as demonstrated when he disguised himself as [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) at the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court) leyline temple
- Master of shadow and elemental combat — conjures elemental blades of cold, fire, lightning, or poison and creates up to four shadow copies of himself
- Stole the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s leyline crystal and planted the **Bodak** in the Spring Temple; **still at large**
- The campaign's **wildcard** — his allegiances remain uncertain heading into the final confrontation

## Personality & Motivation

- Driven entirely by a desire for **meaningful combat** — not money, power, or ideology
- Finds the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s mission tedious but participates because it generates interesting conflicts
- Made a verbal agreement that the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) would duel him after [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s release — but has grown skeptical the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) will honor it
- Increasingly views the **party** as more worthy opponents than anyone in the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)
- Theatrical and playful in combat — taunts opponents, proposes games, and retreats when bored rather than fighting to the death

## The Summer Temple Encounter

- Appeared outside the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court) leyline temple disguised as **[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)** (the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) paladin)
- When confronted, dropped the disguise with a grin and proposed a game: if the party could land **one blow** on him, he'd return the stolen rune crystal
- Proved nearly impossible to hit — dodged effortlessly and teleported around the party
- **[Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist)** won the game by throwing a handful of **ball bearings** at his feet, technically "landing a blow"
- True to his word, Manus handed over the crystal and vanished with mocking praise for their ingenuity
- The returned crystal was later discovered to be **tainted** and could not be restored without knowledge from the [Chained Library](/06---factions/chained-library)
- *"Drawing broken swords now, bird? I do hope you brought sharper company."*

## The Mountain Peak Confrontation

- Intercepted the party at **Evenode Peak** (Tael'anore) in the Feywild, where [Elara Sunforge](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge)'s device was set to capture the "First Kiss of the Midday Sun" for reforging Summer's Edge
- Snapped his fingers and created **magical darkness** covering the entire peak, denying the party the sunlight they needed
- Created **two shadow copies** and fought the party in the dark, where only **[Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)** (with blindsight) could perceive him
- [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) dispelled the darkness, and Manus showed genuine respect before retreating into the shadows
- *"Oops. Looks like your precious kiss of the sun just got lost in the dark. Good luck finding it now."*
- *"Well, well, well. Color me impressed. Didn't think you had that in you. Guess I'll have to step up my game next time."*

## The Bodak Note

- Planted a **Bodak** in the Spring Leyline Temple's crystal chamber using **Oil of Etherealness**, causing major corruption to the temple and surrounding forest
- Left a letter in the Bodak's robes addressed to the party — effectively **betraying the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s plans**:
  - Revealed the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) accelerated the final ritual from the **winter solstice to the next new moon** (~12 days away)
  - Disclosed the ritual location: the **ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed**
  - Expressed growing interest in fighting the party over honoring his deal with the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)
  - Invited them to "crash the party" at the ritual
- *"The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is practically pulling his hair out over your little stunt with that Hollow Threshold. Watching him scramble has been the most entertainment I've had in decades."*
- *"I do hope you'll crash their little party. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) plans to execute his grand ritual at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed away ages ago."*
- *"I'm starting to think you might give me a better fight. You certainly fight with more style than his shadow-drunk cultists."*

## Cult Operations

- Stole one of eight rune crystals from the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court) leyline temple, destroying **two guardian constructs** in the process (using fire and ice magic)
- Planted a **Bodak** accompanied by wraiths and shadows in the Spring Temple's crystal chamber
- Both operations occurred while the party was in the Feywild, where time flowed differently — allowing weeks to pass on the Material Plane
- His actions technically serve the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)'s goals of weakening the leyline barrier, but his letter to the party suggests he may be **deliberately undermining the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)** for entertainment

## Relationship with the Weaver

- Operates as the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s most powerful agent but shows **no genuine loyalty**
- Openly mocks the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and dismisses his ideology as tedious
- Views the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) primarily as someone who promised him a duel — a promise he doubts will be kept
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) lists Manus's disloyalty as a known vulnerability in his own plans
- By revealing the ritual's location and timeline, Manus effectively acts as an **unwitting (or deliberate) double agent**

## Relationship with the Party

- Shows a pattern of **escalating respect** across encounters
- First encounter: tested them with a game; rewarded their cleverness
- Second encounter: tried to deny their mission; acknowledged their strength when they overcame it
- Third contact (the note): actively encouraged them to disrupt the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s plans
- Addresses [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) directly with taunts about his "broken sword" and feathered appearance
- Views the party as increasingly "interesting" — the highest compliment in his personal philosophy

## Potential Allegiance Shift

- Multiple signs suggest Manus may **switch sides** during the final ritual:
  - His note explicitly invites the party to interfere
  - He has expressed more interest in fighting the party than defending the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)
  - If [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s emergence threatens reality itself, Manus may refuse to participate
  - His self-preservation instinct is strong — he retreats rather than dies in every encounter
- If the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) falls or the ritual spirals out of control, Manus may abandon the cult entirely
- Alternatively, he may simply watch from the shadows, intervening only if the fight becomes "interesting" enough
