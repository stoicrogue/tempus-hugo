## Ritual Mechanics

## Tactics
- **Opening:** Casts *greater invisibility* and begins ritual
- **Early Combat:** Uses illusions and positioning, avoids direct confrontation
- **Mid Combat:** Becomes more aggressive, uses higher-level spells
- **Desperate:** Prioritizes ritual completion over survival, may sacrifice himself
