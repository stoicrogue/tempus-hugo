- 1/day: scrying

## Actions

### Multiattack

The hag makes two Dream Claw attacks.

### Dream Claw

_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

If a target is hit by this attack more than once on a turn, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn), until the target takes damage, or until another creature who can reach the target uses their action to wake them. Creatures who can’t be supernaturally put to sleep automatically succeed on this saving throw.

### Vicious Visions (1/Day; 6th-Level Spell)

The hag releases magic dream dust in a 60-foot cone. Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute or until they deal damage to another creature. While charmed, the creature sees all allies as enemies and all enemies as allies.

### _**Change Shape**_

The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

### _**Etherealness**_

The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.

## Reactions

### Aren’t You Tired?

When a creature within 5 feet of the hag hits them with an attack, the hag spits sleep dust at the attacker. The attacker must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, until the end of the hag’s next turn, the attacker feels tremendously sleepy, they can’t take reactions, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Creatures who can’t be supernaturally put to sleep are immune to this effect.

## Villain Actions

**Summon Shadows**

The hag summons 2d4 shadow creatures to appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of it. The shadows are friendly to the hag and obey its commands.

### _**Banish**_

One creature within 120ft must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a contested Charisma check contested by the hag’s. If the creature wins, it escape the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. The creature reappears where it left the material plane.

### _**Telekinesis**_

The hag targets up to three creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Con save or be flung up to 30ft through the air. A creature takes strikes a solid object or is released in midair takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10ft moved or fallen.

### _**Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)**_

While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
