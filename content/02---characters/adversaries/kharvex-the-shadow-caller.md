## Grimoire of the Eclipse

**Description**

A dark, leather-bound tome that contains the forbidden rituals and spells Kharvex used in his experiments. The pages are filled with eldritch symbols and diagrams related to the Shadow Dragon and other entities from the Shadowfell.

**Effect**

The grimoire contains several spells, including shadow blade, summon shadowspawn, and contact other plane.

However, the book is cursed—anyone who attempts to learn its secrets must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 16) or suffer from disturbing nightmares and a gradual loss of sanity.

> The time has come to test the boundaries of our power.You are instructed to conduct a critical experiment. The latent magic left behind from the Shadow Dragon’s sealing ritual holds great potential. I believe this residual energy can be harnessed to enhance the summoning spells contained within the Grimoire of the Eclipse.

> Your task is to channel this dormant energy and weave it into the summoning incantations. Observe how the spells respond—whether the summoned creatures exhibit greater strength, increased ferocity, or a deeper connection to the Shadowfell.
> 
> Take meticulous notes; every detail could prove crucial in our future endeavors. Remember, this experiment is of utmost importance. The success of our grand design hinges on your ability to wield these ancient powers. Do not fail me.
