**Race/Class:** Half-Elf Blood Hunter  

**Background:** A quiet and enigmatic figure, Toby walks the line between light and shadow. Trained to hunt monsters and empowered by forbidden rites, she does what must be done without complaint. Though she rarely speaks at length, her sharp observations often cut to the heart of the matter. She’s the one who reminds the group of the larger threat—the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)—and keeps them focused even when distractions abound. When tough calls are needed, she steps up, whether that means offering her own blood as tribute or striking a deal with a shady figure like [Blackbird](/02---characters/allies/blackbird) to further their cause.  

**Notable Traits:** Grounded realist, moral anchor, throws weapons that return via her **Blinkback Belt**, expert in occult threats.
