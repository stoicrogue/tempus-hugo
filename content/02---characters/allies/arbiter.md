# Arbiter

- **Angel of Justice** serving the **Dusk Lord**, a deity of endings and transitions
- Found deep beneath the Church of the Dusk Lord in **[Tannis](/03---locations/tannis)**, where she had erected a divine barrier to contain [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s darkness curse
- Initially planned to **purge all life** in [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) to cleanse the corruption — the party convinced her to delay and grant them a chance to find the source
- **Marked the party with her holy symbol**, granting safe passage through her barriers, the ability to commune with her, and the Blessing of the Dusk Lord
- Wields a **greatsword of divine energy** that can shatter into homing shards of radiant light; has wings and can teleport
- Was **not involved** in [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s original sealing but recognizes him as an enemy of the Dusk Lord
- Listed among the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)'s known enemies and opposition

## The Dusk Lord

- The Arbiter serves the Dusk Lord, a god who presides over transitions, endings, and the balance between light and shadow
- Her power flows within the bounds of judgment and guardianship — she is forbidden from intervening directly in mortal affairs beyond the liminal spaces she guards: boundaries, temples, and realms between life and death
- She believes mortals must choose to protect their own world, lending wisdom, guidance, and blessings rather than fighting their battles for them
- [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) specifically hates the Dusk Lord and anyone who bears his mark, making the Arbiter and the party natural targets for the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)

## The Darkness of Tannis

- When [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) cursed the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) by defiling a holy symbol of the Dusk Lord, the corruption drew the Arbiter's attention
- She erected a barrier around the town to contain the spreading darkness and began preparing a **purification ritual** — one that would have destroyed all life in [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) to cleanse the corruption
- The party found her in a hidden dungeon level below the church's catacombs and convinced her to delay the cleansing
- They vowed to investigate the source of the curse themselves, and she agreed — marking them with her symbol as emissaries of the Dusk Lord
- As a sign of good faith, she destroyed the remaining shadow monsters in town with a single devastating display of divine power: teleporting above the great oak tree, unfurling her wings, and shattering her greatsword into a thousand shards of homing radiant light that annihilated every shadow creature in [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis)
- She also gave [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) a **+1 Shield of the Dusk Lord** recovered from the church crypt

## The Holy Mark

- The Arbiter's mark was placed on each party member, physically visible on [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)'s shoulder
- The mark grants **safe passage** through divine barriers, the ability to **commune** with the Arbiter across distances, and a **Blessing of the Setting Sun** (1d8 radiant damage, once per long rest)
- Communion with the Arbiter is not a physical appearance — her presence settles over the caller "like a cold wind," her voice "carrying the weight of judgment"
- The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) consider all who bear the Dusk Lord's mark to be priority enemies — the mark grants resistance to illusions and fear, purification of corruption, and access to warded leyline temples
- The mark persists even through the final battle — in the aftermath, [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) reaches up to check that the warmth of the mark is still there

## Cleansing the Curse

- The party discovered [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s altar containing a diorama of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) and a holy symbol of the Dusk Lord that had been magically cursed and defiled with blood
- They used their marks to summon the Arbiter, who confirmed it was the source of the curse that triggered the Dusk Lord's ire
- She cleansed the holy symbol, vowed to release her barrier from [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis), thanked the party, and opened a portal to return and begin her work
- That night, the party dreamed of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) being restored and the Arbiter granting them the Blessing of the Setting Sun

## Ongoing Guidance

- The Arbiter does not have omniscient knowledge — when the party communed with her about the leyline temples, she offered theories and guidance but admitted when she lacked specific answers
- At the **Winter Leyline Temple**, [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) communed with her to understand the cracked crystal; she explained that leylines are paths through which raw magical energy flows, usable for communication, travel, or power
- At the **Summer Leyline Temple**, when the party could not restore a crystal stolen and returned by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus), the Arbiter suggested it needed to be cleansed of evil before it could function — [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) later succeeded with Dispel Magic
- She provided a **gem** to the blacksmith Sig Rockwell, who used it to enchant a wrist blade with radiant damage for [Toby](/02---characters/main-party/toby) — the "Dagger of Brightness"
- In [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)'s nightmares (inflicted by [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)), the Arbiter appeared carrying out her purification ritual on [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) — a vision of what would have happened if the party had failed

## The Final Battle

- During the confrontation against the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) at the ancient battlefield, the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) turned his **Shadowweave bolts** on [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar), hammering him unconscious
- The Arbiter **intervened with divine light**, lifting [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) upright with the message: *"You are still needed here, my champion."*
- Her holy mark remained with every party member through the end of the battle — in the aftermath, [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) reached up to check that the warmth of the mark was still there
- Her protection across the campaign — the mark, the blessings, the guidance — proved to be exactly what the party needed to endure the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s assault and see the ritual stopped
