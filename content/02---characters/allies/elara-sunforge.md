## Roleplay - Requesting Aid from the Smiths

If the party tells the truth about finding _Summer's Edge_ in the knight’s tomb, it could actually work in their favor, though the smiths’ initial reactions will depend on the tone and details the party provides. Here’s how to make this encounter both tense and rewarding:

### 1. **Emphasize the Sacred Legacy**

The smiths would likely view the tomb of a knight from the Order of Seasons as a deeply respected, almost sacred place. Discovering that _Summer’s Edge_ was hidden there would immediately raise their curiosity—and perhaps suspicion. They may see it as a test of worthiness; only those aligned with the Order’s values could have found the sword and interpreted the riddle guarding it.

### 2. **Responses to the Party’s Honesty**

If the party approaches with humility and reverence, explaining how they uncovered the sword and emphasizing their respect for the Order, this would help reassure the smiths that the party didn’t simply plunder it for power.

If the party explains that they face the same threats the Order once did (the Cult of the Eclipse, [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg), etc.), the smiths might interpret this as fate guiding _Summer's Edge_ back to a time of need. This could shift the smiths’ initial suspicion to acceptance, if not admiration.

### 3. **The Potential Trial of Intentions**

For added tension, the smiths might still require proof of the party’s intentions and worthiness. They could ask the party to recount the events that led to finding _Summer’s Edge_ or even share personal values, almost as if the sword itself is judging them. They might test the party’s convictions, loyalty, and dedication, asking the party to take oaths similar to the knight’s original ones.

### 4. **Outcome Possibilities**

If the party is truthful and respectful, the smiths would likely feel a sense of duty to aid them in reforging the sword. For your game, this could build a powerful bond between the party and the Summer Court—one grounded in respect and legacy.

On the other hand, if the party is evasive or disrespectful, the smiths might either refuse the reforge outright or set them on a quest to prove their intentions. This adds flexibility for your campaign’s direction while setting up a satisfying roleplaying moment for your players.

### **Running the Encounter**

- **Set a tone of reverence.** Describe the setting and the smiths’ serious demeanor as they inspect the pieces of _Summer’s Edge._
- **Ask questions through the smiths.** Make them probe the party on their values, motives, and what _Summer's Edge_ represents to them.
- **Let the smiths be guardians of history.** The smiths might share some history of the Order of Seasons, treating the act of reforging the sword as a revival of their values, not just a weapon.
