# Elara Sunforge

- **Summer Eladrin** and **Master Smith of the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)** — renowned as the finest smith in the court
- Reforged the legendary blade **Summer's Edge** using Celestial Ore and the First Kiss of the Midday Sun at a **Secret Elven Forge** beneath her workshop
- Warm, confident, and passionate about her craft — she treats smithing as art and views the reforging of Summer's Edge as the greatest honor of her career
- Commands **sun-forged magic** and works with enchanted tools at a forge fire that never dims
- Listed among the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s leadership alongside Lady Sylvia and knight Adamar

## The Summer Court

- Elara's forge is a large open-air workshop near the Coliseum, the heart of the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s Roman-inspired architecture
- The workshop's centerpiece is a massive rune-inscribed anvil and a roaring forge fire that never seems to dim — the air thick with the scent of molten metal and the hum of magical energy
- Beneath the workshop lies the **Secret Elven Forge** — a vast subterranean chamber with veins of golden leyline energy pulsing beneath translucent crystalline stone, accessed via a narrow stone staircase behind the hearth
- The Secret Elven Forge predates the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court) itself; Elara says: *"This place was old before the first Summer Lady donned her crown. Its heart beats with the sun's song"*
- Lady Sylvia directed the party to Elara when they arrived with the broken pieces of Summer's Edge, telling them such artifacts "have a mind of their own"

## Summer's Edge

- **Summer's Edge** was originally wielded by **Sir Eirik**, Champion of the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court) and Captain of the **[Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons)** — the heroes who sealed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) centuries ago
- The blade broke during the final stand at the **Gates of Season's End** and was hidden in a knight's tomb, where the party recovered it
- Elara recognized the blade immediately and was thrilled: *"You brought me a legend, and you want me to wake it up. It would be my greatest honor to make this whole again to protect the realm once more"*
- To reforge it, she required two rare materials: **Celestial Ore** from the Starfall Crater and the **First Kiss of the Midday Sun** from the Feywild

## The Quest for Materials

- Elara directed the party north to the **Starfall Crater** to retrieve Celestial Ore — a shimmering metal infused with celestial energy, known for exceptional magical conductivity and strength
- The party fought Starfall Sentinels and a Celestial Guardian to prove their worth and returned with the ore, which Elara confirmed was genuine
- For the second material, Elara provided a special **sun-capturing device** and located a fey crossing at the **Shimmering Glade** to the north
- The party crossed into the Feywild and climbed to **Evenode Peak** to capture the sun's essence at its zenith
- **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)** appeared at the peak and attempted to sabotage the effort by casting magical darkness over Elara's device — but the party dispelled it and the device successfully captured the First Kiss of the Midday Sun
- Time flows differently in the Feywild — while only days passed for the party, nearly three weeks slipped by in the material world

## The Reforging

- When the party returned with both materials, Elara led them beneath her workshop to the Secret Elven Forge, saying *"reforging Summer's Edge deserves a special forge closer to the leylines"*
- She laid the broken shards on the ancient anvil *"with gentle, precise care, as though setting down the body of a fallen comrade"*
- Before beginning, she whispered to the sword: *"Your light will burn again. The realms still need you"*
- Each hammer blow rang "like the toll of a temple bell" — the Celestial Ore melted "like molten starlight" into the fractured steel, and the captured sun burst forth in golden light as it was absorbed into the blade
- At the final strike, light exploded outward in a silent wave
- Elara held the completed sword aloft: *"It is done. Summer's Edge lives again. May it burn away all shadows"*
- The party all pointed at [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) when she asked who would take up the blade — as he gripped the hilt, he felt the blade's resolve wash through him: pure, wordless gratitude and unbreakable purpose
- She gave [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) a simple scabbard and promised to craft something more fitting: *"It deserves more. We'll work on something fitting"*
