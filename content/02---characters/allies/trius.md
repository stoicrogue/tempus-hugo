# Trius

- **Eladrin** princess of the **[Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court)**, eldest daughter of Lady **[Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)**
- **Oath of the Ancients Paladin** and wielder of a legendary **Moonblade** — the Winter Knight
- Fought alongside the party against **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)** and dealt more damage than anyone in the encounter
- Her grandmother **Maria** was one of the original elven mages who created the interplanar barrier imprisoning **[Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)**
- Rides a **majestic unicorn** mount and projects a supernatural **battle hymn** into the minds of nearby allies when she draws her blade
- Listed among the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)'s known enemies and opposition

## The Winter Court

- Trius embodies the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court)'s militant strength — she is the court's front-line warrior and heir
- Her mother [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora) rules the court and sends Trius on diplomatic missions, though Trius would rather be fighting
- Her younger sister **Olivia** was poisoned by a Bandersnatch that terrorized the court's lands; Olivia was healed by [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)
- The court's Arch Magus **Levi** serves alongside the royal family, but Trius's grandmother Maria's gift for barriers has not been inherited by anyone in the current generation

## Legacy of the Barrier

- Trius's grandmother Maria was the previous Elven Matriarch who helped create the barrier sealing [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) in the Shadowfell centuries ago
- The [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) has carried the burden of maintaining that barrier ever since — it is woven into the family's legacy
- The **Winter Leyline Temple**, one of four anchoring the barrier, sits within the court's domain
- Trius presented her Moonblade as proof of worthiness to enter the temple, and the temple accepted it — recognizing the weapon's connection to the court's lineage

## Meeting the Party

- Trius first appeared during the party's audience with [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora) after they killed the Bandersnatch plaguing the court
- She entered to deliver a report to her mother, and the party immediately noticed her Moonblade and tried to recruit her
- She initially declined, citing "other pressing matters" — a diplomatic mission — though she was visibly tempted
- The next morning the party ran into her again and promised **more excitement** than diplomacy; she agreed to accompany them to the Winter Leyline Temple
- She guided the party east, riding her unicorn, and led them through the temple's three trial chambers

## The Battle Against Serenity

- On the road back from the leyline temple, the forest drained to grayscale and **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)** — a night hag agent of the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) — ambushed the party
- Trius was "only too eager to help rid her realm of this evil entity" and leapt into the fight without hesitation
- When she drew her Moonblade, the entire party heard an **up-tempo, epic battle hymn** in their minds — inspiring and supernatural
- [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) poured buff spells onto Trius to maximize her effectiveness, and she did **by far the most damage** of anyone in the encounter
- She is described as a "force of nature — deadly, inspiring, and unrelenting" during the battle
- After [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s defeat, the party returned to the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) to report to [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora), with Trius having earned the heroes' deep respect

## Shadicar

- [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) was immediately struck by Trius when she first appeared — described as "beautiful and powerful"
- A **subtle rivalry and possible infatuation** exists between them, though neither has said anything outright
- In combat, [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) devoted his support magic to boosting Trius, doing everything he could to protect her and amplify her damage
- The tension between the Winter Knight and the half-elf bard has been a recurring undercurrent whenever Trius is mentioned

## Impersonated by Manus

- When the party exited the breached **Summer Leyline Temple** on Day 23, they encountered someone who appeared to be Trius — but something felt off, "annoyingly smug and unkind"
- The figure waved a hand and dropped the disguise, revealing himself to be **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)**, a CR 17 shapechanger working with the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)
- That [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) chose Trius's form suggests he had studied her closely enough to replicate her appearance — making her a target of the cult's intelligence
- The moment established [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)'s shapeshifting abilities and created a direct narrative link between the two characters

## The Final Battle

- Trius returns to fight alongside the party in the final confrontation against the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed
- She represents the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) and carries her family's centuries-old stake in keeping the barrier intact
- Her role is as a **tank and support hybrid** — her Aura of Protection passively boosts all nearby allies' saving throws, while her Moonblade and Divine Smites deliver radiant burst damage
- Her stat block and combat reference are maintained separately in [Trius Quick Reference](/05---planning/final-battle/trius-quick-reference)
