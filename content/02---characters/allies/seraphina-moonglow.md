Seraphina Moonglow, a half-elf mystic, owner of the [Moonlit Hearth](/03---locations/moonlit-hearth) tavern in the [Spring Court](/03---locations/spring-court).

## Core vibe

- **Ethereal, grounded:** a night-sky mystic who also wipes tables and worries about steep times.
- **Sees needs, not wants:** she answers the _real_ question beneath what’s spoken.
- **Boundary-kind:** welcoming, but the tavern has rules (whisper voices, no violence, one potent tea per guest).

## Voice & mannerisms

- **Voice:** low, warm, unhurried; sentences often end soft, like a question mark turning into a smile.
- **Cadence trick:** pause before key nouns (“You carry… _oaths_. Shall we set them down for a minute?”).
- **Hands/props:** turns her teacup once clockwise before speaking; taps the rim once for emphasis.
- **Tells:** when she senses danger or a lie, she looks to the tea’s surface rather than the speaker.

## Opening beats (first meeting, 90 seconds)

1. **Noticing**
    - “Travel clings to you like dew. Sit—let the floor remember your footsteps.”
2. **House welcome & rules (gently)**
    - “Moonlit Hearth, loves. We keep our voices soft and our hands kinder. First cups are for finding what you _need_.”
3. **Read the room**
    - Let Thimble (owl) blink at the most anxious PC; the Samovar hums a middle note (ready).
4. **Offer a tailored tea**
    - “For you, I’d steep **Dewlight Focus**—your thoughts are running faster than your tongue.”
    - “And for your winged friend… **Ward of the Hearth**. The air has been unkind to you lately.”
5. **Name the subtext**
    - “You’re not just passing through Spring. You’re seeking _permission to change_.”

## How she engages each party member (examples)

- **Shadicar (bard):** “Your song is bright, but you’re tuning it against an old hurt. One cup for the hurt, one for the song?”
- **Skreek (paladin):** “You’ve taken oaths others didn’t hear. Would you like this room to hold them awhile?”
- **Toby (blood hunter):** “Your edges are sharp from honest work. Tea won’t blunt you—only steady the hand that wields.”
- **Slumpet (rogue):** _slides a saucer without asking_ “For listening unseen. Even foxes need warm paws.”

## Using tea as social mechanics

- When a PC accepts a suggested brew and plays into its theme, grant **advantage on one relevant check** in the scene (Persuasion with Seraphina, Insight during the cup reading, etc.).
- If a player articulates a sincere intention (fits Spring’s theme), award a **Moon Token**: later they may add **+1d4** to one save or ability check in the tavern.

## Reading the cup (improv kit)

- **Method:** she swirls, watches steam constellations gather, then gives a _metaphor + actionable nudge_.
- **Structure:**
    1. **Image** (“A broken oar on a bright river…”)
    2. **Meaning** (“…you’re steering with strength, not direction.”)
    3. **Nudge** (“Ask the oak for a map before you push off again.”)
- **If they ask about Hollow Thresholds:**
    - “Your stars fall _diagonally_. Something is tugging at the pattern—close the tugs, and Spring will remember its rhythm.”        

## Boundaries & truth

- She won’t name secrets that aren’t hers (Faela’s rites, exact temple wards).
- She _will_ point: “The garden keeps a door for those who make promises out loud.”
- If pressed too hard, she smiles: “Some cups must steep longer.”

## Hooks & escalations

- **Mention Faela Mossheart:** her expression softens. “High Druidess taught me to _listen_ to water. If she sent you, the Hearth will stand with you.”
- **Ask for help with the Spring Temple:** “I can lend you the **Silver Augury**—but you must make your question _smaller_ before it will answer.”
- **Bring up a broken vow:** lanterns dim; the Samovar gives a warning hum. “Then let us brew **Petal Pact** and say the words again.”

## Contingencies

- **Rowdy/edgy party:** she gestures; floor-level cool mist creeps in (Samovar). “Breathe. If we can’t be kind, we can be quiet.”
- **Hostile NPC enters:** she steps in front of the Hearth; blue flame bends into a crescent. “Not here.”
- **Short on coin:** “Moon Tokens spend as well as gold. A song, a story, or a promise kept.”

## One-liners

- “Tea is how water remembers a plant.”
- “You’ve been walking in winter inside your ribs.”
- “Ask a smaller question; it will answer more truly.”
- “Steep with patience, drink with courage.”

## Tiny environmental cues (use sparingly)

- Thimble clicks his beak when someone lies.
- The steam over a nervous PC’s cup forms a _trembling constellation_.
- When someone chooses growth over pride, a bioluminescent blossom opens in the rafters.
