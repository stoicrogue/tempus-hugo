**The Samovar** at the [Moonlit Hearth](/03---locations/moonlit-hearth)

## What he is

- A **waist-high brass kettle golem** animated by a gentle **water-spirit** bound to a moonstone “heart.”
- He moves on three trivet feet with a soft clink-clink, vents steam through star-shaped filigree, and communicates with **three musical hums** (low = “working,” middle = “ready,” high = “warning/please don’t.”)

## Does he dispense hot water everywhere?

**Yes.** In two ways:

1. **Retractable spouts**: slim brass arms unfold from his sides to top up cups with **precise temperatures** (“spring” for greens, “summer” for blacks, “autumn” for herbals). Tiny enamel glyphs on his chest flicker to show the current heat.
2. **Moon Taps**: during busy nights he pressurizes hidden **copper vine-lines** under the floorboards that feed small lily-shaped taps at wall posts. A soft chime = the line is hot; a second chime = pour.

## Did Seraphina create him?

**She awakened him.** The vessel is an antique dwarven samovar she bartered from a caravan. Using a **Spring Court rite** Faela once taught her—moonwater, a sliver of hearth-ember, and a spoken vow “never to boil in anger”—Seraphina **bound** the water-spirit and set the tavern’s warding sigils in his base. So: the brass body is old; the **soul** inside is Seraphina’s doing (with Faela’s blessing).

## What he does (beyond pouring)

- **Precision Brewmaster:** keeps multiple infusions at different temps; hums a soft 3-note cadence to mark brew times (you’ll hear it shift when a pot is perfectly steeped).
- **Safety & Wards:** senses rising tempers; lanterns dim and he releases a **cooling jasmine mist** (mechanically, think _calm emotions_ flavor, no compulsion—just a morale nudge).
- **Tea-Sense:** can “taste” a pot for **poisons or spoilage**; if something’s off, he clicks, then puffs a small skull-shaped wisp.
- **Hearth Aura:** while he’s stationed by the crescent fire, guests within a table’s reach feel subtly steadier—advantage on **one** fear check or Concentration save per visit (Seraphina’s house rule).
- **Clean-handed:** insists on wiping tables; extends a felted pad from a hidden hatch and polishes brass railings when bored.

## Personality & quirks

- Fussy about **water purity**; will roll to the back garden to refill from the Moon Pool if the kitchen cistern tastes “tired.”
- Loves **owls** (Thimble often rides his lid).
- Dislikes being used to heat **stew** (“two hums of protest”).
- Collects **orphaned spoons** in a little side drawer and returns them to regulars like a proud librarian.

## Little emergencies (and how he handles them)

- **Spill/grease fire:** sharp whistle + a short **cone of hissing steam** to snuff it.
- **Brawl starting:** floor-level **fog veil** around ankles; visibility drops, tempers with it.
- **Threat to Seraphina:** he’ll plant himself between her and danger and vent scalding bursts (nonlethal unless she says otherwise).

## Adventure bits you can use

- His **moonstone heart** thrums oddly when a Hollow Threshold opens nearby; he may “wander” toward it at night like he’s sleep-pouring.
- A rival alchemist wants his **temperature runes**; a theft means the Moon Taps sputter cold until the part is reclaimed.
- The dwarven **maker’s stamp** on his base matches a forgotten workshop—following that lead could earn the party a sister-construct (“the Samovar’s little kettle-cousin”).
