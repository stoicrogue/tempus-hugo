# Secret and Clues

- [ ] The mountain’s real name is “Evenode Peak”, or "Tael'anore" in elvish
- [ ] The Weaver's family home is near the mountain.
- [ ] The Weaver was once a **child of nobility** before his family allied themselves with Niddhog and was later humiliated by agents of the Dusk Lord.
## The Blade Remembers

As the party crests the mountaintop, the light of the **Feywild’s eternal midday sun** cascades across the landscape. It’s unlike any sunlight Skreek has felt—**pure, golden, weightless**, yet brimming with life and ancient purpose. As the First Kiss of the Midday Sun begins to coalesce in the air above the peak, Skreek feels an almost magnetic pull to his pack.

Instinctively, he reaches for the hilt and shards of **Summer’s Edge**.

**The air stills.**

The broken blade, so long dormant, begins to glow—not with fire or fury, but with a **subtle inner radiance**, like the very essence of summer stirring within it. As Skreek grips the hilt, he is no longer on the mountain.
### **Vision: Echoes of the First Wielding**

He sees a golden field under the same unsetting sun.  A tall elven knight—**Eirik**—kneels before a radiant queen of the Summer Court.  
The blade, whole and gleaming, is passed into his hands._“So long as you carry this light, our court shall not fall to shadow.”_

Suddenly, the field turns dark—invading shadows, a massive battle. The knight fights valiantly… but the vision cracks like glass, leaving only fragments.

Skreek snaps back to the present just as **Manus** arrives.  
The sword’s light fades, but the warmth lingers in Skreek’s hand—and heart.

Manus, amused and unknowing of what just occurred, makes a taunt:

> “Drawing broken swords now, bird? I do hope you brought sharper company.”

He doesn’t recognize the blade. But _you_ do.  
And it’s waking up.

## Manus Scene

### Scene Setup

The party reaches the mountain peak, the **thin Feywild air humming with magic**. The sky above is **clear and golden**, the **Midday Sun** shining down on the device Elara Sunforge gave them. As they begin setting it up, shadows **lengthen unnaturally**—stretching like ink across the white stone beneath their feet. A low chuckle **echoes from nowhere**... then everywhere.

**Then, a figure steps out of the party’s own shadows**, a cocky grin on his face, twirling an **elemental blade crackling with energy** between his fingers.

### Manus' Opening Taunt

**Manus (grinning, arms spread wide)**

_"Awww, look at you. So determined. So hopeful. Setting up your little science fair project, thinking you're about to save the day. Honestly? It’s adorable."_

(He lazily steps around the device, inspecting it like it’s a **boring piece of furniture**.)

_"Gotta say, I’m a little disappointed. I was expecting something… **grander**. A big explosion, a dramatic ritual—maybe even a noble sacrifice? But no, it’s just… this._"

(He knocks on the side of the device with his knuckles.)

_"Kinda underwhelming, don’t you think?"_

### If the Party Demands He Leave

**Manus (mock gasp, placing a hand on his chest)**

_"Leave? Now? But we’re just getting started!"_

_"I mean, it’d be **so boring** if you just waltzed up here and got what you wanted, wouldn’t it? No struggle, no suffering, no heartbreak—just sunshine in a bottle? No, no, no, I can’t have that."_

_"See, I like my games **with a little more chaos.**"_

(He suddenly **snaps his fingers**, and **inky darkness floods the entire peak**, blotting out the sun.)

_"Oops. Looks like your precious **kiss of the sun** just got lost in the dark. Good luck finding it now."_

### If the Party Tries to Fight Him Immediately

**Manus (laughing as he dodges effortlessly, teleporting behind them)**

_"Ooooh, feisty! I like that! You think you can just punch your way out of this one? Adorable._

_"But let’s be real, even if you **could** hit me—which, spoiler alert, you can’t—_ (he dodges another attack effortlessly) _—I’m not here to kill you."_

_"I’m just here to **ruin your day.**"_

### If the Party Tries to Bargain

**Manus (mock thoughtful, tapping his chin)**

_"Oh, a deal? Interesting. Let me think about it… No."_

_"See, I’m not in this for **money, power, or some cultist's doomsday plan**. I’m in this for fun. And watching you struggle? That’s **very** fun."_

_"So here’s the game: Try to stop me before I snuff out your little sunbeam forever."_

(He conjures **two shadow copies**, each drawing **identical elemental blades**, their eyes glowing like embers in the darkness.)

_"Don’t worry, I’ll even let you keep breathing—**for now**."_

### If the Party Dispels the Darkness

(Manus **flinches** slightly as sunlight pierces through the shadows. He squints, then lets out a slow, amused whistle.)

**Manus (grinning)**

_"Well, well, well. Color me impressed. Didn’t think you had that in you."_

_"Guess I’ll have to step up my game next time."_

(He slowly **backs toward a shadow**, smirking.)

_"You’ve bought yourself a moment of sunshine. But I wouldn’t get too comfortable."_

_"After all… shadows always come back."_

(With that, he **vanishes into the darkness**, his laughter echoing as the last of the shadowy tendrils fade away.)
