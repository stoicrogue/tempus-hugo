### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

### Session Notes

- [[Shadicar]] had vivid nightmares of the day his village was destroyed
    - [[Serenity]] was in his dream, chaos all around her. When Shad noticed her, he was thrust out of the dream
- Vidrir asked to hold the pieces of [[Summer’s Edge (orig)]] before the party left.
    - When he held the sword, his hair slightly stood on end, and a warm smile washed over his face. He seemed grateful and made the party promise to return when the sword is reforged so he could see it in all its glory.
- Befriended a pixie named Fannie in the forest by playing along with her pranks.
- Fannie’s friends are being held captive by a group of grey-skinned halflings ([[Darkling]])?
- The party agreed to help Fannie rescue her friends and will turn [[October “Toby” Daye]] into a dinosaur to help them storm the camp
- [[Slumpet Zoommimist]] scouted ahead and found the camp where the pixies are being held
