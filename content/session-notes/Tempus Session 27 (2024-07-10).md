### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

## The Harvest Wheel Puzzle

### Description

The Harvest Wheel is a large, intricately designed wheel set into the floor or wall of a chamber within the Autumn Ley Line Temple. The wheel is divided into several segments, each representing a different aspect of the autumn season. The party must turn the wheel to align the symbols in the correct order, reflecting the natural cycle of autumn.

### Symbols

The wheel features the following symbols, each representing a key element of the autumn season:

1. **Harvest (Cornucopia):**
    - Symbol: A cornucopia overflowing with fruits and vegetables.
    - Meaning: The time of reaping the fruits of labor and abundance.
2. **Decay (Fallen Leaf):**
    - Symbol: A single fallen leaf, beginning to rot.
    - Meaning: The process of decay as plants and leaves break down, returning nutrients to the soil.
3. **Preparation for Winter (Acorn):**
    - Symbol: An acorn, symbolizing the storage of resources and preparation for the colder months.
    - Meaning: The gathering and storing of food and supplies to survive the winter.
4. **Change (Changing Tree):**
    - Symbol: A tree with leaves in various stages of color change (green to red/yellow).
    - Meaning: The transition and transformation of nature as it prepares for the coming winter.
5. **Festival (Bonfire):**
    - Symbol: A bonfire, representing autumn festivals and celebrations.
    - Meaning: The gatherings and rituals held to honor the season and its changes.
6. **Migration (Birds in Flight):**
    - Symbol: A flock of birds flying south.
    - Meaning: The migration of animals to warmer climates as the season changes.

### The Puzzle

The wheel is initially locked, with the symbols in a random order. The party must turn the wheel to arrange the symbols in the correct sequence to unlock the next passage or reveal a hidden mechanism.

### Solution

The correct order of the symbols on the Harvest Wheel should follow the natural progression of the autumn season:

1. **Change (Changing Tree):** The leaves begin to change color, signaling the start of autumn.
2. **Harvest (Cornucopia):** The time of reaping the fruits of labor and gathering the bounty of the season.
3. **Festival (Bonfire):** Celebrations and rituals held to honor the harvest and the season.
4. **Migration (Birds in Flight):** Animals and birds begin their migration to warmer climates.
5. **Preparation for Winter (Acorn):** Gathering and storing resources to prepare for the winter months.
6. **Decay (Fallen Leaf):** The final stage, where leaves and plants decay, returning nutrients to the earth.

### Mechanism

- **Turning the Wheel:** The wheel can be turned in both directions, but each segment must click into place before the next can be moved.
- **Incorrect Alignments:** If the symbols are not aligned correctly, traps are triggered or additional enemies are summoned. For example:
    - **Falling Leaves Trap:** A flurry of razor-sharp leaves is released, dealing slashing damage.
    - **Summoning Constructs:** More animated autumn constructs appear to challenge the party.

### Clues and Hints

The chamber may contain murals or carvings that depict the cycle of autumn, providing hints for the correct order of the symbols. Additionally, the party could find ancient scrolls or receive guidance from a guardian spirit of the temple.

### Example Dialogue for the Puzzle

As the party approaches the Harvest Wheel, you can read the following:

---

The large, intricately designed wheel stands before you, its surface divided into segments, each bearing a distinct symbol of autumn. The wheel is currently locked, and the symbols are in disarray. Surrounding the wheel, the chamber's walls are adorned with murals depicting the cycle of the autumn season.

**Murals:**

- You see a mural of leaves changing color, followed by a scene of abundant harvest.
- Next, there is an image of a grand bonfire, with figures dancing around it in celebration.
- Further along, birds are shown flying south, followed by scenes of squirrels gathering acorns.
- Finally, there is a depiction of fallen leaves decaying into the earth.

To unlock the wheel's mechanism, you must align the symbols in the correct sequence, reflecting the natural progression of autumn. As you study the murals, you realize they hold the key to solving this puzzle.
