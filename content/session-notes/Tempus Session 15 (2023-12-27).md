### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

    - Skreek bought two nets
- Found a nice inn to rest for the night, the Restful Buck, relishing in the chance to sleep in a proper bed for the first time in weeks
    - Jared - elven bartender
    - Shad performed for tips and some free drinks; not his greatest performance but he did take a nice pot off the smithy in a game of poker after catching his tell
    - Discovered the court is headed by Alora, the Lady of Winter
    - Heard rumors that Alora’s daughter, Olivia, had been poisoned
- Sought an audience with Alora the next day, around noon
    - Alora was guarded at first by softened when the party showed her Vidrir’s medallion from the Order of Seasons
    - She was obviously distracted by her daughter’s illness and would focus on little else until her daughter was safe
- Skreek used his lay on hands to heal Olivia
    - Alora was overjoyed and thanked the party, promising to discuss their topics of interest now that her daughter is safe
    - Alora is still concerned about the creature that poisoned her daughter.
