### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

## Scratchpad

_Jot down notes during your game. Use it for a text-based combat tracker or anything else. Copy and paste from here into Discord for example. Here's more on [playing D&D and Discord](https://slyflourish.com/playing_dnd_over_discord.html) and a [Markdown-based battle map](https://slyflourish.com/text-based_battle_maps.html)._

### Session Notes

- Met Trius in the morning
- PIcked up some horses and traveled to the Leyline Temple, led by Trius
- Each member presented something important to them to prove their worth to enter the temple
- A tomb guardian in the first chamber materialized and challenged someone to single combat. Skreek stepped up to the challenge and was able to emerge victorious
- …
- Continued into the second chamber, which was a trapped bridge flanked by “ice lasers” that shot the party if they stepped on the wrong tiles covering the bridge
- Continued to the final chamber, which contained the leyline crystal and the surrounding arcane circle meant to establish the barrier.
- Left the temple and road back home, only to encounter Serenity on the way, seemingly out for blood and desperate to get her dark crystal back.
