### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

- Fought a rug of smothering that was guarding a trapdoor
- Trapdoor led to a creepy chamber that contained an alter and a diorama of the city of Tannis
- Shad touched the crystal orb on the alter. The orb seemed to try to attack his ming, but he resisted. The orb was wrapped up and taken by the party.
- Discovered a curse had been placed on the amulet that had been stolen from the temple of the Dusk Lord
- Party called the Arbiter and she was summoned to investigate. She was able to cleanse the amulet, which she said would lift the darkness curse on the town. The Arbiter should now be able to lift the barrier surrounding the town.
