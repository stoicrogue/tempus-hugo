# Spring Court

The Spring Court embodies renewal, growth, and gentle transformation. Guided by the High Druid [Faela Mossheart](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart), it values personal development and healing over oaths of power. The court was the last temple the party visited — and the first to fall to corruption.

## Leadership

- **[Faela Mossheart](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart)** — High Druid of Spring. Centuries-old elf who wears layers of living moss and bark-woven robes, carries a staff sprouting blossoms, and leaves wildflowers blooming in her footsteps. Calm and maternal but not passive — proved her strength by wildshaping into a saber-tooth tiger. Performed the Seed Ritual with the party at the Spring Temple. Taught [Seraphina](/02---characters/allies/seraphina-moonglow) the Spring Court rite to awaken the Samovar.
- **[Seraphina Moonglow](/02---characters/allies/seraphina-moonglow)** — Mystic proprietor of the [Moonlit Hearth](/03---locations/moonlit-hearth) tavern. Half-elf with one silver eye and one spring-green eye. Reads tea leaves for divination and sees needs, not wants. Learned water-listening from [Faela](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart).

## The Seed Ritual

A sacred rite performed at the [Spring Leyline Temple](/03---locations/spring-leyline-temple). [Faela](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart) gives each participant a seed to plant in the soil around the temple. Each seed binds to the person's "intent to grow" — a personal resolution or vow for positive change. Seeds sprout into flowers reflecting the character's spirit, with color and condition revealing emotional states.

**Party vows:**
- **[Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)** — Make the world better through music
- **[Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)** — Restore order by retrieving the stolen artifact
- **[Toby](/02---characters/main-party/toby)** — Reduce bitterness and pain for companions
- **[Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist)** — Dwarves will get what's coming to them

## Leyline Temple Status

The [Spring Leyline Temple](/03---locations/spring-leyline-temple) is the most heavily corrupted of the four temples. Signs of corruption when the party arrived: birds avoided the area, the ground was unnaturally cold, new growth was twisted or withered, and flowers bloomed only to rot. A Bodak had been placed inside the leyline crystal chamber by the Cult of the Eclipse, and nearby Hollow Thresholds continued to siphon power from the leyline network.
