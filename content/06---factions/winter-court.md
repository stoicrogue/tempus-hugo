# Winter Court

The Winter Court is the most magically sophisticated of the four seasonal courts, governed by an ancient eladrin lineage responsible for maintaining the interplanar barrier that keeps [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) sealed in the Shadowfell.

## Leadership

- **[Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)** — Lady of Winter. Regal, composed, and deeply burdened queen of the court. Watches over the leyline barriers protecting the realm from extraplanar intrusion. Her mother created the original barrier using ancient power, but no one in her lineage has inherited the gift, so the barrier weakens with each passing century. Gifted the party a Leyline Gate Ring.
- **[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)** — Princess of Winter / Winter Knight. Eldest daughter of [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora). Oath of Ancients Paladin who wields a legendary Moonblade. Embodies the court's militant strength and accompanied the party to the [Winter Leyline Temple](/03---locations/winter-leyline-temple).
- **Levi** — Arch Magus. [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)'s court wizard who briefed the party alongside her about the barrier system.
- **Olivia** — Daughter of [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora). Was poisoned by a Bandersnatch; healed by Skreek using Lay on Hands, which earned the party [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)'s trust.

## Key Locations

- **[Winter Court Outpost](/03---locations/winter-court-outpost)** — Border settlement at the edge of the winter realm. Adorned with ethereal silver banners and a towering silver maple over 100 feet tall with crystalline leaves. Ice sculptures depicting elven lore flank the entrance.
- **The Restful Buck** — Inn and tavern within the court proper. Head bartender Jared oversees a regular poker game, a small performance stage, and an enchanted sound system. Known for excellent mulled wine.
- **Night Garden's Circle** — Apothecary and magic shop.
- **[Winter Leyline Temple](/03---locations/winter-leyline-temple)** — Ancient temple embedded in a hillside with a mechanical iris entrance. Contains three trial chambers culminating in the Leyline Crystal Chamber. One of six focus crystals is cracked and flickering — damaged by the Cult of the Eclipse.

## Culture & Identity

- Aesthetic blends elven elegance with faint blue crystal technology
- Values magical scholarship, duty, and guardianship
- The court carries the heaviest burden of the seasonal barrier — [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)'s lineage built it, and her line is responsible for its upkeep
- Elven rangers patrol the borders and respond to the Order of Seasons medallion

## Leyline Temple Status

The [Winter Leyline Temple](/03---locations/winter-leyline-temple) features a giant purple leyline crystal surrounded by six hovering arcane focus crystals. One crystal is cracked and flickering, damaged by the Cult of the Eclipse. The entrance requires proof of worthiness — blood, the Order of Seasons symbol, or a crystal leaf from the great silver maple.
