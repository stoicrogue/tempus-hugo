description: "Major organizations and power groups in the world of Tempus, from the seasonal Fey courts to secretive guilds."
---
The major organizations and power groups the party has encountered. The Feywild's four seasonal courts -- Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter -- are central to the campaign's conflicts. You'll also find the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) (the ancient knightly alliance that sealed Nidhogg), the Chained Library (a secretive order of knowledge-keepers), the Massa'Ista, and the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) (the shadow-worshipping cult seeking to free Nidhogg).
