# Autumn Court

The Autumn Court is the most diplomatic of the four seasonal courts, renowned for mediation and peace-making. Ruled by the legendary negotiator Lord Farkris, it carries a Japanese-inspired aesthetic of maple groves, torii gates, and seasonal festivals.

## Leadership

- **Farkris (Lord Thalorin)** — Lord of Autumn. Centuries-old autumn eladrin renowned as one of the greatest diplomats and mediators in the Fey realms. Sharp angular features, deep warm amber eyes, long auburn hair with golden highlights. Wears robes of deep red, gold, and brown with a cloak of enchanted autumn leaves and a circlet of intertwined branches. Regretted failing to make peace with [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) centuries ago. Was shocked to learn the barrier was weakening — [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora) had not warned him.
- **Sovis** — Prince of Autumn. Son and heir of Farkris.
- **[Hencelle](/02---characters/allies/hencelle)** — Master of Feasts. Earth genasi and former monk who runs the [Aki Matsuri](/03---locations/aki-matsuri) and serves as chief organizer of the court's festivals.

## Key Locations

- **Autumn Court Entrance** — Marked by a serene river crossing with calm, tranquil waters. A grand Torii gate at the river's edge symbolizes the transition from the mortal world to the sacred realm. A standing stone sits on a small outcropping north of the gate.
- **[Aki Matsuri](/03---locations/aki-matsuri)** — "Fall Festival" in Japanese. A beautiful beer garden nestled among serene Japanese maple trees of red and orange, run by [Hencelle](/02---characters/allies/hencelle). Features food stands, artists, vendors, and entertainers. Site of the party's encounter with [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker).
- **Autumn Leyline Temple** — Accessed through a hill that peeled open by ancient magic. Entrance guarded by a treant who required proof of worth. Features a rotating seasonal puzzle depicting the cycle of autumn. The only leyline temple found intact and stable.

## Leyline Temple Status

The Autumn Leyline Temple is the only temple the party found completely intact and stable. Its leyline crystal and six focus crystals were undamaged. Entry required proving worth to a guardian treant — the party earned passage by saving a baby unicorn from bloodthirsty vines during a dire wolf ambush.
