# Cult of the Eclipse

The Cult of the Eclipse is a shadow-worshipping organization devoted to freeing [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg), the Great Shadow, from his imprisonment in the Shadowfell. Led by the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), the cult systematically works to weaken the interplanar barrier by corrupting leyline temples, tearing open portals to the Shadowfell, and spreading fear across the realm. Their motto, inscribed on cult medallions: *"Darkness will descend once again."*

## Leadership

- **[The Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)** — Cult leader. A wizard and illusionist who orchestrated the systematic weakening of the planar barriers. Operated from a gothic castle stronghold in the Feywild concealed by Mirage Arcane, containing a broken loom infused with dark illusion magic. Originally interested in using [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s image as a "fantastic illusion," but his ambitions evolved into a plan to execute a summoning ritual at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed. **Killed at the ancient battlefield** by [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)'s Moonbeam spell during the failed summoning ritual. His Echo — a spectral remnant of his soul bound to the Feywild castle — was also defeated when [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) struck the decisive blow and unraveled it.
- **[Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker)** — Herald of the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver). Black dragonborn sorcerer who observes natural phenomena and twists them into signs of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s impending return, painting doomsday visions to recruit followers. Publicly proclaimed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s return at the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court)'s Aki Matsuri festival. **Defeated by the party.**
- **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)** — Night hag cult agent, real name "Old Polly Pigtooth." Over 300 years old. Cursed the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) using rituals taught by the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and communed with [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) through a seeing stone. Her journal revealed an obsession with sharing [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s "darkness" with the realm. **Permanently killed by the party.**
- **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)** — Enigmatic elemental duelist and shapechanger (CR 17). Despite cult affiliation, openly mocked the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and was motivated by testing himself against worthy opponents rather than ideology. Stole the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s leyline crystal. During the final battle at the ancient battlefield, the Weaver's desperate shockwave pushed Manus too far — he wheeled on the Weaver in fury: *"This is too far — I didn't sign up for this!"* — and appeared ready to switch sides. **Current whereabouts unknown.** Allegiance remains ambiguous.
- **[Kharvex, the Shadow Caller](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller)** — Cult mage who received direct instructions from the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) to test summoning magic using residual energy from [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s original sealing ritual. Created the *Grimoire of the Eclipse*. **Defeated by the party on the ancient battlefield.**

## Core Goals

1. **Free [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)** — The cult's ultimate purpose. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) planned a summoning ritual at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed, tearing open a fifteen-foot portal to the Shadowfell to release the shadow dragon. **FAILED — ritual stopped and the Weaver killed before completion. [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) remains sealed.**
2. **Destroy the Leyline Barrier** — The interplanar barrier that keeps [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) imprisoned is anchored at four seasonal leyline temples. The cult targeted each temple to weaken the barrier from multiple points. Partial damage was achieved across three of the four temples before the Weaver's death disrupted the organization.
3. **Open Hollow Thresholds** — Unstable portals connecting the Material Plane to the Shadowfell, each anchored by a dark artifact. These siphon leyline energy, pull shadow creatures into the world, and corrupt the surrounding land. Four Hollow Threshold locations were identified by [Vael](/02---characters/allies/vael) of the [Chained Library](/06---factions/chained-library); at least one (the Tempest Gate in Winter Court territory) has been addressed.
4. **Spread Fear and Recruit** — Through [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker)'s public proclamations and acts of terror like the [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) Darkness, the cult recruits desperate followers with promises of salvation.
5. **Enhance Summoning Magic** — [Kharvex](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller)'s experiments aimed to harness residual energy from [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s sealing ritual to amplify shadow summoning spells, documented in the *Grimoire of the Eclipse*.

## Key Locations

- **The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s Feywild Castle** — A gothic castle in the Feywild concealed by Mirage Arcane, appearing to balance on a spire above a sinkhole. Contained a broken loom infused with dark illusion magic. A spectral Echo of the Weaver's soul was bound here and was defeated by the party. The Weaver's study, hidden behind a tapestry, held his personal journal, a map of leyline energy, and the Silmirien spell. Accessible only to the cult's inner circle.
- **[Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) Tomb** — Site of the cult's earliest known operation, where goblins and bugbears conducted a dark ritual and kidnapped Winry.
- **Greyscale Cabin** — Defiled cult site in corrupted woods containing a shadow dragon altar and [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s seeing stone.
- **Ancient Battlefield** — Where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s chosen site for the final summoning ritual. A fifteen-foot portal pulsing with the runes of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s original sealing was erected here; the ritual was stopped and the Weaver killed at this location.
- **[Hollow Threshold](/03---locations/hollow-threshold) Sites** — Multiple tears in reality scattered across the realm, each anchored by dark artifacts and siphoning leyline power.

## Leyline Temple Sabotage

The cult's central strategy is to damage or corrupt the four seasonal leyline temples that anchor [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s prison barrier. Progress as encountered by the party:

| Temple | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [Winter Leyline Temple](/03---locations/winter-leyline-temple) | One of six focus crystals cracked and flickering |
| [[Summer Leyline Temple]] | Breached; two guardian constructs destroyed; one rune crystal stolen by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) |
| [Spring Leyline Temple](/03---locations/spring-leyline-temple) | **Cleared** — Bodak and undead defeated by party; [Faela Mossheart](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart) confirmed corruption removed |
| Autumn Leyline Temple | Intact and stable (only undamaged temple) |

The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s intercepted letter to [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker) confirmed the strategy: *"The Shadow Dragon's freedom hinges on the weakening of the barrier. We must secure the leyline temples where the barrier is anchored."*

## Party History

- **Sessions 2-4** — First encounter with cult forces at the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) Tomb; goblins and bugbears kidnapped Winry for a dark ritual; party recovered an eclipse medallion from a bugbear leader
- **[Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) Darkness** — Discovered [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s curse on the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis), an impenetrable magical darkness that threatened to consume everything; recovered her journal revealing cult operations and her seeing stone
- **Cult Camps** — Found cult operatives moving through forests creating "colorless regions" where nature dies; rescued pixies kidnapped by darklings allied with the cult
- **Winter Temple** — [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora) revealed the weakening barrier system; party found the Winter leyline crystal already damaged by the cult
- **Summer Temple** — Temple breached by cult forces; [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) stole a rune crystal after destroying guardian constructs
- **Autumn Festival** — [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker) publicly proclaimed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s return at the Aki Matsuri and warned of further attacks; **defeated by the party**
- **Spring Temple** — Found the most corrupted temple with a Bodak planted in the crystal chamber and active Hollow Thresholds; confirmed the cult's accelerating timeline
- **Ancient Battlefield (Kharvex)** — Confronted [Kharvex](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller) and his summoning experiments; **defeated him** and recovered the *Grimoire of the Eclipse*
- **[Chained Library](/06---factions/chained-library)** — Party gained access using Summer's Edge as a key, sacrificing personal items for entry. [Vael](/02---characters/allies/vael), Fifth Binder, identified four Hollow Threshold locations. Library records revealed the Elven barrier can be repaired but requires several mages a month or more, and that barrier crystals can be mined south of the Elven forest.
- **Weaver's Feywild Castle** — Party infiltrated the gothic castle, destroyed the Weaver's broken loom, and confronted and defeated his Echo — a spectral remnant of his soul bound to the stronghold. [Slumpet](/02---characters/main-party/slumpet-zoommimist) struck the killing blow. The Weaver's journal and leyline map were recovered.
- **Spring Temple (Cleared)** — Party defeated the Bodak and undead planted there by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus); [Faela Mossheart](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart) confirmed the corruption was removed.
- **Ancient Battlefield (Final Battle)** — The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) performed the final ritual under a moonless sky, erecting a fifteen-foot portal. [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) arrived on her unicorn Moonblade. The Weaver cast Maze to remove [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) from battle, hammered [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) unconscious (the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) intervened to revive him), and drove [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) to action. When the Weaver's desperate shockwave went too far, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) turned on him in fury. [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) called down a pillar of silver moonlight (Moonbeam) that passed through the Weaver like a blade through smoke. **The Weaver is dead. The ritual failed. [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) remains sealed.**
- **Current Status** — The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is dead; the immediate threat of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s release has been averted. The Spring Temple has been cleared. The party holds a leyline map with all four temple and Hollow Threshold locations. Remaining Hollow Thresholds are still active. The Elven barrier is damaged and requires significant effort to repair. [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) is still at large with unclear allegiances.
