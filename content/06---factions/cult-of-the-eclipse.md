# Cult of the Eclipse

The Cult of the Eclipse is a shadow-worshipping organization devoted to freeing [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg), the Great Shadow, from his imprisonment in the Shadowfell. Led by the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), the cult systematically works to weaken the interplanar barrier by corrupting leyline temples, tearing open portals to the Shadowfell, and spreading fear across the realm. Their motto, inscribed on cult medallions: *"Darkness will descend once again."*

## Leadership

- **[The Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)** — Cult leader. A wizard and illusionist who orchestrates the systematic weakening of the planar barriers. Operates from a tower stronghold in the Feywild, hidden inside a mirage arcane spell that appears as a sinkhole. Originally interested in using [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s image as a "fantastic illusion," but his ambitions evolved into a plan to execute a summoning ritual at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed.
- **[Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker)** — Herald of the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver). Black dragonborn sorcerer who observes natural phenomena and twists them into signs of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s impending return, painting doomsday visions to recruit followers. Publicly proclaimed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s return at the [Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court)'s Aki Matsuri festival. **Defeated by the party.**
- **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)** — Night hag cult agent, real name "Old Polly Pigtooth." Over 300 years old. Cursed the village of [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) using rituals taught by the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and communed with [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) through a seeing stone. Her journal revealed an obsession with sharing [Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s "darkness" with the realm. **Permanently killed by the party.**
- **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)** — Enigmatic warrior and shapechanger (CR 17). Despite cult affiliation, openly mocks the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) and appears motivated by testing himself against worthy opponents rather than ideology. Stole the [Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)'s leyline crystal. Allegiance remains ambiguous.
- **[Kharvex, the Shadow Caller](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller)** — Cult mage who received direct instructions from the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) to test summoning magic using residual energy from [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s original sealing ritual. Created the *Grimoire of the Eclipse*. **Defeated by the party on the ancient battlefield.**

## Core Goals

1. **Free [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)** — The cult's ultimate purpose. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) plans a summoning ritual at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed, tearing open a portal to the Shadowfell to release the shadow dragon.
2. **Destroy the Leyline Barrier** — The interplanar barrier that keeps [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) imprisoned is anchored at four seasonal leyline temples. The cult targets each temple to weaken the barrier from multiple points.
3. **Open Hollow Thresholds** — Unstable portals connecting the Material Plane to the Shadowfell, each anchored by a dark artifact. These siphon leyline energy, pull shadow creatures into the world, and corrupt the surrounding land.
4. **Spread Fear and Recruit** — Through [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker)'s public proclamations and acts of terror like the [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis) Darkness, the cult recruits desperate followers with promises of salvation.
5. **Enhance Summoning Magic** — [Kharvex](/02---characters/adversaries/kharvex-the-shadow-caller)'s experiments aimed to harness residual energy from [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s sealing ritual to amplify shadow summoning spells, documented in the *Grimoire of the Eclipse*.

## Key Locations

- **The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s Feywild Stronghold** — A tower in the Feywild surrounded by a mirage arcane spell, appearing to balance on a spire above a sinkhole. Accessible only to the cult's inner circle.
- **[Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) Tomb** — Site of the cult's earliest known operation, where goblins and bugbears conducted a dark ritual and kidnapped Winry.
- **Greyscale Cabin** — Defiled cult site in corrupted woods containing a shadow dragon altar and [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s seeing stone.
- **Ancient Battlefield** — Where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed. The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s chosen site for the final summoning ritual.
- **[Hollow Threshold](/03---locations/hollow-threshold) Sites** — Multiple tears in reality scattered across the realm, each anchored by dark artifacts and siphoning leyline power.

## Leyline Temple Sabotage

The cult's central strategy is to damage or corrupt the four seasonal leyline temples that anchor [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s prison barrier. Progress as encountered by the party:

| Temple | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [Winter Leyline Temple](/03---locations/winter-leyline-temple) | One of six focus crystals cracked and flickering |
| [[Summer Leyline Temple]] | Breached; two guardian constructs destroyed; one rune crystal stolen by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) |
| [Spring Leyline Temple](/03---locations/spring-leyline-temple) | Most heavily corrupted; Bodak planted in crystal chamber; nearby Hollow Thresholds siphoning power |
| Autumn Leyline Temple | Intact and stable (only undamaged temple) |

The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s intercepted letter to [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker) confirmed the strategy: *"The Shadow Dragon's freedom hinges on the weakening of the barrier. We must secure the leyline temples where the barrier is anchored."*
