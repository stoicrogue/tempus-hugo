# Summer Court

The Summer Court is the most vibrant and competitive of the four seasonal courts. Styled after ancient Rome, it celebrates strength, craftsmanship, and valor. Home to the legendary smith [Elara Sunforge](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge), who reforged Summer's Edge — the blade of the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons).

## Leadership

- **Lady Sylvia** — Lady of Summer. Took news of the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) seriously and asked the party to investigate the Summer Leyline Temple. Recognized that Summer's Edge chooses its own wielder and directed the party to [Elara Sunforge](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge) for reforging. Vowed to coordinate with the other courts.
- **[Elara Sunforge](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge)** — Master Smith. Most skilled smith in the Summer Court, renowned across the Fey realms. Reforged Summer's Edge using Celestial Ore and the First Kiss of the Midday Sun at the [Secret Elven Forge](/03---locations/secret-elven-forge) beneath her workshop.
- **Adamar** — Knight of the Summer Court. Dueled [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) in the Coliseum to test the reforged Summer's Edge.

## Key Locations

- **The Coliseum** — Massive arena at the center of the court. Architectural marvel with tiered seating for thousands. Hosts gladiatorial combat, archery contests, and dueling tournaments. [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) won a tournament here testing Summer's Edge.
- **[Elara](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge)'s Forge** — Large open-air workshop near the Coliseum filled with enchanted tools. Centerpiece is a massive rune-inscribed anvil and a forge fire that never dims.
- **[Secret Elven Forge](/03---locations/secret-elven-forge)** — Hidden beneath [Elara](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge)'s workshop via a narrow stone staircase behind the hearth. A vast subterranean chamber with veins of golden leyline energy pulsing beneath crystalline stone. Where Summer's Edge was reforged.
- **Ember's Embrace** — Lively inn and tavern run by Serra Flamekissed (fire genasi). Known for flaming shots.
- **Summer Leyline Temple** — Already breached when the party arrived. Two guardian constructs destroyed by fire and ice magic. One of eight rune crystals stolen by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus), later recovered but tainted.

## Leyline Temple Status

The Summer Leyline Temple was breached by the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse) before the party arrived. Two guardian constructs were destroyed. One rune crystal was stolen by [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) and later recovered, but it was tainted and could not be restored without knowledge from the [Chained Library](/06---factions/chained-library).

## Artifacts & Legends

**Summer's Edge** — "The Blade of Dawning Light." Originally wielded by Sir Eirik, Champion of the Summer Court and Captain of the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons). Broken during the final stand at the ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed. Reforged by [Elara Sunforge](/02---characters/allies/elara-sunforge) using Celestial Ore from Starfall Crater and the First Kiss of the Midday Sun from the Feywild. Currently wielded by [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek).
