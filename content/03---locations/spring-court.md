## 🌿 Thematic Pillars

- **Renewal & Growth:** Spring represents change, personal development, and the courage to bloom after hardship.
- **Contracts of Intention:** The Court values commitments to self-improvement and healing over oaths of power or allegiance.
- **Gentle Judgment:** Unlike the ambition of Summer or the solemnity of Winter, Spring’s authority is quiet but unwavering.
- **Landmarks:**
	- [[Endless Meadow]]
	- [[Grand Windmill]]
	- [Spring Leyline Temple](/03---locations/spring-leyline-temple)

## 👩‍🌾 Key NPC

[Faela Mossheart](/02---characters/allies/faela-mossheart) - High Druid

- **Race:** Elf (likely centuries old, with a presence that feels both ancient and nurturing)
- **Appearance:** Wears layers of living moss, bark-woven robes, and carries a staff sprouting blossoms. Her hair is vine-wrapped and flowers bloom in her footsteps.
- **Personality:** Calm, maternal, but not passive. Sees potential in all things — including the party.
- **Role:** Guide to the Spring Temple; speaks in gentle riddles and seasonal metaphors. May be the only one who can truly commune with the temple's ancient spirit.
