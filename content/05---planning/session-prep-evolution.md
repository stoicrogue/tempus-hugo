# Session Prep Evolution

An analysis of how DM session preparation has evolved across 45+ sessions of the Tempus campaign, from November 2022 to January 2026.

## Three Phases of Evolution

### Phase 1: Experimental (Sessions 00-05, Nov 2022 - Apr 2023)

The campaign began with Session 00 as a pitch document establishing core philosophy:
- **Theater of the Mind combat** emphasized over grid-based tactical play
- Collaborative world-building with player input
- "Player driven" and "Weird" as campaign priorities

Early session notes followed a simple structure with sections for Characters, Locations, NPCs, Monsters, Treasure, and an unstructured "Scratchpad." Format was still experimental with inconsistent checkbox usage and incomplete sections. Prep was light—scene lists often had placeholder language like "They find the church casting light..." without full details.

### Phase 2: Structured Consistency (Sessions 10-23, Jul 2023 - May 2024)

The template solidified into a consistent format following the **Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master** methodology:
- Characters table (passive scores for quick reference)
- Strong Start
- Scenes (with checkboxes)
- Secrets and Clues (trackable revelations)
- Fantastic Locations
- NPCs
- Monsters
- Deadly Encounter Benchmark calculation
- Treasure
- Scratchpad/Session Notes

Session notes remained relatively sparse despite the structured template. External resources became consistent—Donjon treasure generator, D&D Beyond links, Sly Flourish articles.

### Phase 3: Enhanced Preparation (Sessions 30-47, Oct 2024 - Jan 2026)

A significant shift toward more elaborate preparation while maintaining flexible structure:

**Visual formatting introduced** (Session 43+):
- Emoji-enhanced headers for quick scanning
- Clear visual hierarchy in encounter design

**Exhaustive stat blocks** replaced simple monster name references:
```
**Bodak** (CR 6)
- AC/DC 15, HP 58 (44-72)
- Attack +6, DPR 35
- Death Gaze, Withering Gaze abilities with specific DCs
- Damage resistances and immunities listed
```

**Elaborate encounter frameworks** replaced simple scene lists:
- Session 35 introduced a d12 "Weakening Barrier Encounters" table with 12 distinct scenarios
- Conditional options prepared for player agency
- Subsections organizing complex social encounters (e.g., "Feast with a Satyr Warband" → "Drinking Contest" → "Bargain for Merriment")

**Narrative prose sections** added:
- "Cold Open" sections with atmospheric scene-setting
- Evocative location descriptions with quoted lore
- Example from Session 47: "What extends out in front of you is a circular platform of black stone suspended over a boiling sea of storm cloud..."

## Key Observations

### Paradox of "Lazy" Prep
Despite adopting the Lazy Dungeon Master philosophy (explicitly referenced in Session 30), preparation has become MORE detailed over time. The methodology's purpose—structured preparation enabling better improvisation—manifests in preparing multiple contingencies rather than minimal notes.

### Combat Prep Investment
Mathematical precision increased dramatically in late sessions. Early prep referenced monster names; late prep includes AC, HP ranges, attack bonuses, DPR calculations, and full ability descriptions. This suggests increased tactical combat complexity as the campaign approached its climax.

### From Lists to Frameworks
Early sessions used linear checklists. Late sessions use interconnected frameworks—encounter tables, conditional branches, and hierarchical organization that support responsive play rather than railroad prep.

### Obsidian Integration
Use of internal wiki-links (`[[NPC Name]]`, `[[Location]]`) increased over time, building a more interconnected knowledge base rather than isolated session documents.

## Tools and Resources Used
