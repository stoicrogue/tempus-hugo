# THE ARBITER'S AID - TABLE REFERENCE

## How to Access

**Before/During Combat:** Party members can use their **holy marks from the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)** to commune with her and request aid. This is a **free action** that can be done once before or during the final battle.

**Automatic Trigger:** The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) watches over those who fight for justice. Her intervention may trigger when her champions fall.

## ARBITER'S BLESSING OF JUSTICE (Proactive - Player Choice)

### Activation
- Any party member can use their holy mark to call upon the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)
- Takes no action (can be done at start of combat or on any turn)
- **Can only be used once during the final battle**

### Effect
When activated, the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s voice rings out: 

*"You fight for justice against the shadow. Receive my blessing, champions of light."*

**All party members bearing her mark gain:**
- **15 temporary hit points**
- **Advantage on saving throws vs fear and charm for 1 minute**
- **Weapons count as magical and deal +1d6 radiant damage for 1 minute** (10 rounds)

### Visual
- Holy symbols on their bodies glow with golden-white light
- Weapons shimmer with radiant energy
- A translucent image of the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) appears briefly above the battlefield

### Notes
- Temp HP stacks with other sources
- Radiant damage applies to all weapon attacks (including [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)'s Summer's Edge, [Francis](/02---characters/allies/francis-the-flameskull)'s rays, etc.)
- Time limit means party must choose strategic moment to activate

## ARBITER'S INTERVENTION (Reactive - Automatic)

### Trigger
**The first time** a party member bearing the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s mark drops to 0 hit points during the final battle

### Effect
The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s divine energy surges through the fallen champion:

*"Not yet, champion. Justice still requires your blade."*

**The fallen party member:**
- **Immediately stabilized at 1 hit point** (no death saves needed)
- **Stands up automatically** (doesn't use movement or action)
- **Gains 20 temporary hit points**
- **Glows with holy light** - attacks against them have disadvantage until the start of their next turn

### Visual
- Divine light erupts from their holy mark
- They float briefly as radiant energy courses through them
- The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s voice echoes across the battlefield
- [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)'s Shield of the Dusk Lord may shine particularly bright

### Notes
- This only triggers **once per combat** (first party member to drop to 0 HP)
- Does not consume their [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s Blessing - these are separate abilities
- Can combine with [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s Blessing for maximum protection
- After temp HP is lost, character is vulnerable again

## TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

**[Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s Blessing Timing:**
- **Early:** Maximizes duration, helps survive opening rounds
- **Mid-fight:** Save for when ritual reaches dangerous phases
- **Desperate:** Use when party is overwhelmed

**[Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s Intervention:**
- Automatic safety net for first knockout
- Doesn't prevent subsequent deaths
- Party should still be cautious after first intervention

**Combined Strategy:**
- If party calls Blessing early and someone still drops to 0, Intervention saves them
- Creates two layers of divine protection
- Still requires smart play to survive

## NARRATION SUGGESTIONS

**When Party Calls for Blessing:**
> "As [character] presses their hand to the holy mark, it blazes with golden light. The temperature shifts, and you feel a presence—ancient, powerful, just. The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s voice rings in your minds: 'You fight for justice against the shadow. Receive my blessing, champions of light.' Warmth floods through you as radiant energy courses into your weapons and shields."

**When Intervention Triggers:**
> "As [character] crumples to the ground, their holy mark suddenly erupts with brilliant light. Time seems to slow. A voice—stern but protective—echoes across the battlefield: 'Not yet, champion. Justice still requires your blade.' Divine energy lifts them back to their feet, wounds knitting just enough to continue the fight."

**[Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s Reaction (optional):**
> "The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s eyes widen in recognition and fury. 'The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)'s pet warriors,' he hisses. 'Even her divine meddling won't save you from [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s shadow!'"

## LORE REMINDER

- The party earned these marks by convincing the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) to spare [Tannis](/03---locations/tannis)
- They later helped cleanse [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)'s altar to the shadow dragon
- The [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter) recognizes they fight against **[Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)** (who hates the Dusk Lord)
- This is the culmination of their relationship with her throughout the campaign
