### Weaver chooses Option B to advance ritual

> On the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s turn, even as he weaves spells and commands, part of his attention is always tethered to the portal. As he concentrates, a second ring of runes blooms around the portal—about five feet wider in every direction. It’s hazy, unstable, like heat shimmer over a fire. The air screams with strain. You get the sense that this ‘new edge’ of the portal is unfinished… and vulnerable.

### If they hit the 50-damage threshold

> As your blows land, that hazy ring fractures like crystal under a hammer. The runes flash, then scatter into sparks and ash. The portal snaps back to its previous, stable size—angry, but contained.

### If the Weaver successfully advances

> On the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s turn, he deliberately commits—hands steady, eyes empty, voice like a knife through silk. The hazy ring hardens, the runes lock into place with a sound like iron cooling in water, and the portal swells to fill that new space. The new, larger edge looks… stable. Finished. For now.
