## Actions

**Multiattack.** Manus makes three elemental weapon attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Elemental Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing + 7 (2d6) elemental damage (fire, cold, lightning, or poison).

*Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing + 7 (2d6) elemental damage.

**Shadow Clone Creation (Recharge 4-6).** Manus creates 1-2 shadow copies of himself within 30 ft. Each copy has the same AC and abilities but only 50 HP. Copies last until destroyed or Manus is incapacitated. Manus can have maximum 2 copies active at once.

**Taunting Challenge (1/Day).** Target within 60 ft. must make DC 18 Wisdom save or be compelled to attack Manus with disadvantage on attacks against other targets for 1 minute. Save ends effect.

## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Passage.** Teleport up to 60 ft. (dim light/darkness only).

**Weapon Swap.** Change between elemental blades and bow.

**Combat Flourish.** After hitting with a weapon attack, can push target 10 ft. or knock prone (target's choice).

---

## Reactions

**Parry and Riposte.** When hit by a melee attack, +4 AC against that attack. If it misses, make one weapon attack against the attacker.

**Spell Turning.** When targeted by a spell of 3rd level or lower, make DC 15 Charisma save. On success, spell reflects back at caster.

---

## Legendary Actions (2 per turn)
**Move.** Manus moves his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
**Attack.** Makes one weapon attack.  
**Shadow Step (Costs 2).** Uses Shadow Passage and makes one attack.

---

## Encounter-Specific Behavior

**Opening Rounds:** Manus creates 1-2 shadow copies and positions them tactically. Uses hit-and-run tactics, testing the party's abilities.

**Mid-Combat:** Becomes more aggressive as he realizes the party's strength. Uses *Taunting Challenge* to isolate strong fighters.

**Late Combat:** If the Weaver is in serious trouble OR if Nidhogg's emergence threatens reality itself, Manus may switch sides, shouting something like "This isn't the fight I wanted!" 

**Defeat Condition:** If reduced to 25% HP, Manus may attempt to flee via *dimension door*, respecting the party's strength.

---

## Tactical Notes

- **Primary Role:** Divide party attention, control battlefield positioning
- **Secondary Threat:** Dangerous but not overwhelming while Weaver is active
- **Character Arc:** May betray Weaver if ritual goes too far
- **Escape Route:** Has multiple mobility options, doesn't fight to the death

## Scaling Notes

**If Encounter Too Easy:** 
- Manus creates maximum shadow copies
- Uses higher-level spell slots more freely
- Shadow copies gain +25 HP

**If Encounter Too Hard:**
- Manus focuses on one party member (his "chosen opponent")
- Reduces shadow copy creation
- May spend rounds taunting rather than attacking
