# Welcome to the Tempus Campaign

You're joining the final session of a campaign that has been running since November 2022. The party of four heroes has spent 44 in-game days (and 45+ real-life sessions) tracking down and dismantling a cult that wants to unleash an ancient shadow dragon upon the world. Tonight, they confront the cult's leader in a battle to save reality itself.

You'll be playing **[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)**, a paladin ally who fought alongside the party earlier in the campaign. Below is everything you need to know to step into her boots.

## Who Is Trius?

**[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)** is a princess of the **[Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court)**, eldest daughter of **Lady [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)**, the ruler of the Winter fey. She is an **Oath of the Ancients Paladin** and a warrior of quiet confidence, trained from birth to protect the natural order of the Feywild. She wields a **Moonblade** -- a legendary weapon passed down through her family line.

[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) carries herself with regal composure, but she's no stuffy noble. She respects strength, cleverness, and conviction, and she proved that by fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the party when they visited her court.

### Trius and the Party

[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) first met the heroes when they arrived at the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) seeking answers about a weakening magical barrier. She guided them to the **Winter Leyline Temple**, where they explored its trials together. She then fought alongside them against **[Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity)**, a night hag cult agent who had been terrorizing the region.

The party earned [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)'s genuine respect -- and her mother [Alora](/02---characters/allies/alora)'s trust -- through their bravery during those events.

She also shares a **subtle rivalry and possible infatuation** with **[Shadicar](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)**, the party's half-elf bard. They're drawn to each other but neither has said anything outright. Feel free to play into this however feels right to you at the table.

### Why Is Trius Here Tonight?

[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius)'s family has a deeply personal connection to this fight. Her **grandmother** was one of the elven mages who originally built the magical barrier imprisoning [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) centuries ago. The [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) has carried the burden of maintaining that barrier ever since. If it falls, everything her family has protected for generations will be destroyed.

She has come to represent the [Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court) and to stand with the heroes she fought beside before.

## The Story So Far

### The Short Version

A cult called the **[Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse)** has been working to free **[Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)**, an ancient shadow dragon imprisoned in the Shadowfell over 300 years ago. The cult's leader, a master illusionist called **the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)**, is about to perform a ritual at the battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed. If the ritual succeeds, [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) escapes, and eternal darkness consumes both the Feywild and the mortal world.

### How It All Started

The four heroes met by chance in a village tavern and answered a blacksmith's plea to rescue his kidnapped daughter. That rescue led them into a cultist tomb, where they stumbled onto something much bigger. Shortly after, the village of **[Tannis](/03---locations/tannis)** was consumed by magical darkness -- a curse placed by the cult. An **angel called the [Arbiter](/02---characters/allies/arbiter)** contained the corruption and marked the heroes with her symbol, tasking them with finding the source.

### The Leyline Temples

The heroes learned that an ancient barrier between worlds is maintained by **four leyline temples**, one in each of the seasonal Fey Courts (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn). The cult has been systematically damaging these temples to weaken the barrier. The party traveled to all four courts:

- **[Winter Court](/06---factions/winter-court)** -- Hunted a Bandersnatch, explored the temple with [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius), and defeated [Serenity](/02---characters/adversaries/serenity) the night hag
- **[Autumn Court](/06---factions/autumn-court)** -- Battled [Xolthos](/02---characters/adversaries/xolthos-omenspeaker), a dragonborn herald of the cult, at a harvest festival
- **[Summer Court](/06---factions/summer-court)** -- Encountered **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)**, an enigmatic shapechanger working with the cult, and recovered a stolen temple crystal
- **[Spring Court](/06---factions/spring-court)** -- Found the most heavily corrupted temple and discovered a note from [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) revealing the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s plans

### Summer's Edge

The party recovered and reforged **Summer's Edge**, a legendary blade wielded by the ancient **[Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons)** -- the original heroes who sealed [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg). The reforging required a journey into the deep Feywild to capture rare materials. Time flows differently there, and while only days passed for the heroes, weeks slipped by in the real world. The cult exploited their absence to accelerate their plans.

### The Truth About Vidrir

The party's mentor, an old sage named **[Vidrir](/02---characters/allies/vidrir)**, turned out to be the last surviving member of the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) -- and, more than that, **Odin himself** in disguise. He has been personally maintaining [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s seal with his own divine power for centuries.

## Your Allies

### Skreek (Aarakocra Paladin)
An **aarakocra** (bird-person) paladin who wields **Summer's Edge**, the legendary reforged blade. [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) is noble, devout, and a strong aerial combatant. He carries the legacy of the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons). Summer's Edge deals radiant damage, sheds light, and can grant **True Sight** -- critical for fighting the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), whose power relies on illusion.

### Shadicar / "Shad" (Half-Elf Bard)
The party's heart and spokesperson. [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar) has a **deeply personal vendetta** against the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) -- the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) conjured an illusion of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) so terrifyingly real that [Shad](/02---characters/main-party/shadicar)'s entire village **died of fright**. He was the sole survivor. He's charming, emotional, and a powerful support caster. He and [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) have unspoken tension between them.

### Slumpet Zoommimist (Gnome Rogue)
A fey-touched gnome rogue with a knack for getting into trouble and finding creative solutions. She befriended a group of pixies, stole a map she probably shouldn't have, and once won a challenge against the shapechanger [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) by throwing ball bearings at him. Clever, impulsive, and surprisingly perceptive.

### October "Toby" Daye (Half-Elf Blood Hunter)
The party's grounded realist and moral anchor. [Toby](/02---characters/main-party/toby) is a dual-wielding blood hunter who channels crimson rites through his blades. He's an expert in occult threats and keeps the party from doing anything too reckless. Steady and reliable in a fight.

### Francis the Flameskull (NPC Ally)
A floating, flaming skull the party befriended early in the campaign. [Francis](/02---characters/allies/francis-the-flameskull) is enthusiastic about setting things on fire, immune to many conditions, and surprisingly loyal. He flies around shooting fire rays and occasionally dropping fireballs.

## The Enemy

### The Weaver
An **elven wizard and master illusionist** who leads the [Cult of the Eclipse](/06---factions/cult-of-the-eclipse). He views reality as a loom he can reshape through illusion and fear. His illusions are supernaturally potent -- they literally killed an entire village. He is an 18th-level spellcaster with a spell save DC of 19. His illusion spells function as one level higher than the slot used.

**Key vulnerability:** The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is **vulnerable to truth**. When affected by True Sight or divination magic, he loses his damage resistances and has disadvantage on spell attack rolls. Summer's Edge (carried by [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek)) can target him through any illusion.

### Manus (Wildcard)
A CR 17 shapechanger who works with the cult but openly mocks the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver). [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) is motivated by finding worthy combat, not by ideology. He once disguised himself as [Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) to mess with the party. He's the one who secretly told the party where and when the ritual would happen. His loyalties are uncertain -- he could fight against the party, or he could turn on the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) if the situation becomes interesting enough.

### Nidhogg
The ancient shadow dragon imprisoned in the Shadowfell. He led undead legions that nearly drowned the Feywild in shadow before being sealed away. If freed, he would bring eternal darkness and devastation across multiple realms. You won't be fighting [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) directly -- the goal is to **stop the ritual before he can break through**.

---

## Tonight's Mission

The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is performing his summoning ritual at the **ancient battlefield where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was originally sealed** centuries ago. The ritual progresses through phases over several rounds of combat. If it completes, [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) escapes and the world ends.

**Your goal is simple: stop the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) before the ritual is complete.**

The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) must maintain concentration to advance the ritual. Disrupting his concentration, incapacitating him, or killing him are all paths to victory. As the ritual progresses, the environment will become more dangerous -- shadow effects, fear auras, and the growing presence of [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) pressing against the barrier.

## Playing Trius

Your separate **[Trius](/02---characters/allies/trius) Quick Reference** sheet has all of your combat abilities, but here's the quick version of how she plays:

- **Tank and support hybrid** -- AC 20 with strong saves and an aura that boosts nearby allies
- **Aura of Protection** is passive and always on -- allies within 10 ft get +2 to all saving throws just by standing near you
- **Round 1:** Cast **Bless** (boosts the whole team's accuracy and saves), then attack twice with your Moonblade
- **Round 2+:** Attack twice every turn and spend spell slots on **Divine Smite** when you hit for burst radiant damage
- **Misty Step / Fey Step** lets you teleport 30 ft as a bonus action to reposition
- **Lay on Hands** (30 HP pool) can pick up a downed ally in an emergency
- **Divine Smite** deals extra damage against undead (+1d8), which may come up

**Your role in the party:** Stay near the frontline to share your aura, help [Skreek](/02---characters/main-party/skreek) apply pressure to the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), use Bless to boost the whole team, and burn Divine Smites on big hits when they count. You're the party's second paladin, which means strong saves and radiant damage everywhere.

*This is the culmination of a three-year campaign. Have fun, hit hard, and help save the world.*
