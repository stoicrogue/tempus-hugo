- **Shadow Bind:** Target within 60 ft. makes DC 19 Dex save or restrained by shadow tendrils (escape DC 19).
- **False Images:** Create 3 illusory duplicates that last until hit or end of turn.

**Phase 3: Channel Nidhogg (1/turn).**
- **Dragon's Fear:** All creatures within 60 ft. make DC 19 Wis save or frightened and must move away from Weaver.

## Legendary Resistances (3/Day)

If the Weaver fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Ritual Mechanics

- **Ritual Progress:** Advances 1 stage per round while Weaver is conscious and not incapacitated
- **Interruption:** If Weaver is incapacitated for 1 full round, ritual pauses
- **Failure:** If Weaver is incapacitated for 2+ consecutive rounds, ritual fails
- **Completion:** After 7 rounds of progress, Nidhogg begins to emerge (campaign consequence)

## Tactics
- **Opening:** Casts *greater invisibility* and begins ritual
- **Early Combat:** Uses illusions and positioning, avoids direct confrontation
- **Mid Combat:** Becomes more aggressive, uses higher-level spells
- **Desperate:** Prioritizes ritual completion over survival, may sacrifice himself
