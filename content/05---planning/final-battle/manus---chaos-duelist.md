**Taunting Challenge (1/Day).** 
Target within 60 ft. must make DC 18 Wisdom save or be compelled to attack [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) with disadvantage on attacks against other targets for 1 minute. Save ends effect.

**Conjure Shadow Self (Recharge 5–6).**
[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) has become one with darkness and has mastered the ability to transfer his life into it. **At the start of [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)’s turn**, if this ability isn’t available, roll a d6. On a **5–6**, the ability recharges. **When available**, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) conjures **up to two** shadow copies of himself in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. **[Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) can have at most 4 shadow copies at a time**; if he conjures beyond this limit, he chooses which existing copies collapse into shadow.
- To create a shadow copy, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) must sacrifice 45 of his remaining hit points, giving those HP to the shadow copy.
- These copies are indistinguishable from how [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) appears currently and are capable of anything [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) is capable of doing except cast spells or use Conjure Shadow Self.
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)’ original body and any shadow copies he currently controls are also allowed to swap places within that 60 feet. 
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) can have a maximum of four shadow copies active at any given time. 
- Shadow copies use [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus)’ stats for any checks or saving throws.
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) cannot drop to 0 hit points or below by using this ability. These clones stay active so long as [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) is conscious.
- The shadow copies only take actions, other than reactions, when [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) uses a legendary action to command them.
- To command these shadow copies, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) must use a legendary action. The shadow copies then use that legendary action to take a full turn (action, bonus action, movement, reaction, etc.). *Clones can’t use reactions other than opportunity attacks*

**Spellcasting:** 12th-level spellcaster, save DC 18, +11 to hit.  
**Spell Slots:** 1st(4), 2nd(3), 3rd(3), 4th(3), 5th(2), 6th(1)

- **Weapon Swap.** Change between elemental blades and bow.
- **Combat Flourish.** After hitting with a weapon attack, can push target 10 ft. or knock prone (target's choice).
## Reactions

- **Parry and Riposte.** When hit by a melee attack, +4 AC against that attack. If it misses, make one weapon attack against the attacker.
- **Spell Turning.** When targeted by a spell of 3rd level or lower, make DC 15 Charisma save. On success, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) redirects the spell to a new target of his choosing.

## Encounter-Specific Behavior

- **Opening Rounds (1-2):** [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) hangs back and toys with the party — hit-and-run strikes, taunting remarks, no shadow copies yet. He's treating this like sport, not war. He does **not** use Taunting Challenge or create shadow copies during this phase. If the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) yells at him to get serious, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) responds with something dismissive: _"Fine, fine. Though I'm starting to wonder if your little ritual is worth the trouble..."_
- **Round 3+ ([Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) seriously threatened):** [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) creates **one** shadow copy (never two) and begins applying real pressure. Uses Taunting Challenge to isolate whoever is threatening the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) most. This is the moment the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) snaps at him and demands he stop playing around.
- **Betrayal Trigger:** When the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s Reality Rupture fires (≤62 HP), [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) reads the room and realizes this has gone further than he signed up for. He switches sides, turning on the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver). His line: _"This isn't what we agreed to."_ His shadow copy immediately collapses — he's done splitting his focus.
- **After Betrayal:** [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) targets the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) exclusively. He doesn't help the party tactically and won't take direction from them — he has his own score to settle and makes that clear.
- **Defeat Condition:** If reduced to 25% HP at any point, [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) escapes via _Dimension Door_, unwilling to die for anyone else's cause.

## Tactical Notes

- **Primary Role:** Divide party attention, control battlefield positioning
- **Secondary Threat:** Dangerous but not overwhelming while [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is active
- **Character Arc:** May betray [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) if ritual goes too far
- **Escape Route:** Has multiple mobility options, doesn't fight to the death

## Scaling Notes

**If Encounter Too Easy:** 
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) creates maximum shadow copies
- Uses higher-level spell slots more freely
- Shadow copies gain +25 HP

**If Encounter Too Hard:**
- [Manus](/02---characters/adversaries/manus) focuses on one party member (his "chosen opponent")
- Reduces shadow copy creation
- May spend rounds taunting rather than attacking
