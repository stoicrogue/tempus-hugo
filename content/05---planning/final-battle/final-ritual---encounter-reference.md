## RITUAL ADVANCEMENT

> [!important] [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) chooses Option A or B each turn

### Option A: Focus on Ritual (Full Action)
- Advances ritual by **1 phase immediately**
- Can use bonus action & reactions
- **NO legendary actions this round**
- NO multiattack or spells

### Option B: Combat Normally
- Use multiattack + spells as normal
- Ritual auto-advances +1 phase every **2 rounds** of concentration
- Can use legendary actions

### Ritual Progress Track
- **Phase 1:** Rounds 1-2 => Portal Forming
- **Phase 2:** Rounds 3-4 => Portal Growing
- **Phase 3:** Rounds 5-6 => [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) Approaches
- **Phase 4:** Rounds 7+  => Breakthrough Imminent

### Disruption
- [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) incapacitated 1 round = ritual pauses
- [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) incapacitated 2+ consecutive rounds = ritual **regresses 1 phase**

## LAIR ACTIONS

> [!important] Automatic - Initiative 20
> **Roll 1d3 each round to determine effect**

### Phase 1 Effects (Rounds 1-2)
1. **Shadow Tendrils** - 60ft radius from portal, DC 15 Dex save or grappled (DC 12 escape) + 1d8 cold damage
2. **Disorienting Echoes** - All creatures DC 15 Wis save or disadvantage on next attack roll & ability check
3. **Unstable Ground** - 20ft radius area becomes difficult terrain, creatures starting turn there DC 14 Dex or prone

### Phase 2 Effects (Rounds 3-4)
1. **Portal Magnetism** - 60ft radius from portal, DC 16 Str save or pulled 15ft toward portal; 9 (2d8) force if pulled into portal
2. **Reality Fracture** - 30ft cone, DC 16 Int save or incapacitated until end of next turn _if fail by 5+_, otherwise disadvantage on attacks and concentration checks until end of next turn.
3. **[Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg)'s Whispers** - All creatures DC 16 Cha save or charmed by [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) until end of next turn

2. **Planar Rift** - Roll on Wild Magic Surge table (reality becoming unstable)
3. **Dragon's Presence** — 100ft radius, DC 15 Wis save or frightened of the portal until the end of their next turn. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of their next turn, ending the effect on a success.

## Weaver Ritual Phase Abilities

### Phase 1-2: Illusory Master
- **Illusory Advantage:** When casting illusion spell, automatically create 3 illusory duplicates (as Mirror Image)
- **Shadow Bind:** Can replace one Shadowweave Bolt with: Target within 60ft, DC 19 Dex save or restrained (escape DC 19)

### Phase 3: Dragon's Herald
- **Channel [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg):** When Shadowweave Bolt hits, target DC 19 Wis save or frightened of [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) until end of their next turn
- **Reality Tear:** Can replace one legendary cantrip with: 20ft radius difficult terrain, 2d8 necrotic damage (Dex save negates)

### Phase 4: Desperate Measures
- **Desperate Power:** Bonus action, sacrifice 50 HP to advance ritual by 1 round of progress
- **Portal Shield:** Attacks against [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) have disadvantage if he's within 15ft of portal

## BATTLEFIELD TERRAIN FEATURES

### A. Central Ritual Circle/Portal

- **All Phases (Base Portal):** A **15-ft diameter** vertical circle of crackling shadow. A creature that passes through takes **4d8 necrotic** and is violently expelled back onto the battlefield (appearing in the nearest unoccupied space you choose).
- **Lighting:** The portal sheds **dim light in a 10-ft radius** that grows darker and more oppressive as phases advance.
- **Phase 3+: Shadowfell Bleed:** Any creature that starts its turn **within 10 ft** of the portal takes **1d6 necrotic** (Shadowfell seep).

#### Ritual “Growth Ring” Visual

- Whenever the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) is actively advancing the ritual toward the next phase step, a **secondary ring** of runes appears around the portal: **fuzzy, unstable, ~5 ft larger in diameter** than the current stable portal.
- If the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) successfully advances, the fuzzy ring **solidifies** and the portal **expands to fill the new space** (the portal is now larger and **stable/locked**).
- If the party disrupts it (see Portal Counter), that fuzzy ring **shatters** and the portal **snaps back** to its prior stable size.

#### Portal Counter Disruption Mechanic

- The portal cannot be destroyed, but it can be **set back**.
- **Unlocked window (damageable):** The portal can be targeted/damaged **only while the fuzzy growth ring is present** (portal is “unstable/growing”).
- **Locked window (immune):** Once the growth ring **solidifies**, the portal is stable and **immune to damage/effects** until the next time the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) begins pushing it outward again.
- While the portal is **Unlocked**, track **Portal Counter Damage**.
- When Portal Counter Damage reaches **50**, the portal **reverts to the last stable point** and the **Portal Counter Damage resets to 0**.

> [!important] Don’t explain the mechanic outright 
> - If the party hasn’t interacted with the portal by rounds 2–3, let a stray attack graze it: the growth ring flickers, cracks, or briefly destabilizes.
> - **Arcana (DC 20):** Clearly identifies the “growth ring” as the ritual’s vulnerable edge and reveals the **50 damage** disruption threshold.
### B. Dark Shadow Pools

- **All Phases:** Looking into pool (or starting turn adjacent) = DC 15 Wis save or disadvantage on next attack (seeing horrific visions of death)
- **Phase 3+ escalation:** DC becomes 17, failure also causes 1d6 psychic damage

## CRITICAL MOMENTS

### Weaver reaches 25% HP (62 HP) - Reality Rupture

[Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) slams his staff into the ground, causing reality to shatter:
- **All creatures within 60ft of portal:** DC 19 Constitution save
  - **Fail:** 24 (5d8) force damage; **Success:** Half damage
- Ritual **advances 1 phase immediately**, up to phase 4
- Terrain within 30ft of portal becomes **difficult terrain**
- [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) gains **+1 legendary action per round** (total of 3)
- **Ongoing:** Creatures starting turn within 30ft of portal take 7 (2d6) psychic damage

### PC pulled into portal
- Takes 4d8 necrotic damage
- Expelled back to battlefield
- Gains advantage on saves vs fear for rest of encounter

### Manus Betrayal Trigger (Choose One)
- [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)'s Reality Rupture triggers
- [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) below 40% HP (100 HP)
- Portal reaches Phase 4
- DM's choice for dramatic timing
