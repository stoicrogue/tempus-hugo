# The Weaver's Final Ritual - Encounter Design

## Encounter Overview
**Location:** The Ancient Sealing Grounds (where Nidhogg was originally imprisoned)  
**Party Level:** 13  
**Encounter Difficulty:** Deadly (Multi-phase boss encounter)  
**Duration:** 6-8 rounds expected

## The Battlefield

### Key Features (Reference Map)
- **Central Ritual Circle:** Ancient arcane markings where the original sealing took place
- **Elevated Platforms:** Stone ruins providing tactical high ground
- **Water Features:** Dark pools that reflect the growing Shadowfell influence
- **Broken Structures:** Provide cover but may be damaged by the ritual's energy
- **Multiple Entry Points:** Party can approach from various directions

### Environmental Conditions
- **Dim Light:** Shadowy energy from the weakening barrier
- **Unstable Ground:** Some areas may crack or shift as reality warps
- **Planar Bleed:** Shadowfell energy seeps through as ritual progresses

## Ritual Phases

### Phase 1: The Ritual Begins (Rounds 1-2)
**Portal Status:** Flickering void appears above ritual circle  
**Weaver:** Begins incantation, uses defensive spells and illusions  
**Manus:** Engages party with restraint, testing their abilities  

**Environmental Effects:**
- Shadows lengthen and move unnaturally
- Temperature drops noticeably
- 1d4 **Shadow Spawns** emerge each round

**Lair Actions:**
- **Shadow Web:** One creature within 60ft makes DC 16 Dex save or restrained by shadows (1 turn)
- **Disorienting Echoes:** All creatures hear whispers; DC 15 Wis save or disadvantage on next attack
- **Unstable Ground:** 20ft radius area becomes difficult terrain

### Phase 2: The Veil Weakens (Rounds 3-4)  
**Portal Status:** Stable tear 10ft wide, growing  
**Trigger:** Start of Round 3, or if Weaver drops to 75% HP  
**Weaver:** More aggressive spells, begins using ritual-specific abilities  
**Manus:** Creates shadow copies, becomes more serious

**Environmental Effects:**
- All light sources dimmed by one category
- Shadowfell creatures can see perfectly, others have disadvantage on Perception
- 2d4 **Shadow Spawns** emerge each round
- Fear aura: DC 14 Wis save at start of turn or frightened (1 turn)

**Lair Actions:**
- **Shadow Grasp:** Portal attempts to pull one creature; DC 17 Str save or pulled 15ft toward portal
- **Reality Fracture:** 30ft cone of confusion energy; DC 16 Int save or stunned (1 turn)
- **Nidhogg's Whispers:** All creatures hear the dragon; DC 15 Cha save or charmed by Weaver (1 turn)

### Phase 3: Nidhogg Stirs (Rounds 5-6)
**Portal Status:** 20ft wide, dragon's presence felt  
**Trigger:** Start of Round 5, or if Weaver drops to 50% HP  
**Weaver:** Desperate, may sacrifice HP for powerful effects  
**Manus:** If still alive, fights with full intensity

**Environmental Effects:**
- Overwhelming dread: DC 16 Wis save at start of turn or frightened and cannot approach portal
- Shadow creatures have advantage on all rolls
- Difficult terrain in 30ft radius of portal from writhing shadows
- 3d4 **Shadow Spawns** emerge each round

**Lair Actions:**
- **Dragon's Roar:** Thunderous roar from portal; all creatures make DC 18 Con save or deafened and 2d8 thunder damage
- **Shadow Flood:** 60ft radius of portal becomes heavily obscured by shadow for 1 round
- **Planar Rift:** Random magic surge effects as reality becomes unstable

### Phase 4: Desperate Gambit (Round 7+)
**Portal Status:** 30ft+ wide, dragon's shadow visible  
**Trigger:** Start of Round 7, or if Weaver drops to 25% HP  
**Weaver:** All-or-nothing, may attempt to complete ritual even if it kills him

**Environmental Effects:**
- If ritual seems to be failing, Nidhogg attempts to pull ALL creatures into Shadowfell
- All creatures within 60ft of portal: DC 19 Strength save or pulled 20ft toward portal
- Entering portal = transported to Shadowfell (potential campaign consequence)
- Reality warping: teleportation and dimensional magic unreliable

## Victory Conditions
- **Primary:** Defeat or incapacitate the Weaver for 2+ consecutive rounds
- **Secondary:** Destroy ritual components (very difficult, requires specific actions/spells)
- **Failure:** Nidhogg escapes in weakened form, barrier significantly damaged

## Encounter Scaling
- **If party is struggling:** Manus might switch sides if the ritual threatens reality itself
- **If encounter is too easy:** Additional shadow creatures, environmental hazards activate faster
- **Emergency escape:** Weaver might attempt planar escape if ritual fails completely

## Key Tactical Elements
1. **Positioning matters:** Portal effects are range-based
2. **Target priority:** Stop Weaver vs. deal with Manus
3. **Environmental awareness:** Use terrain, avoid portal pulls
4. **Resource management:** Long encounter, need to pace spell slots/abilities
5. **Moral choices:** Save civilians/allies who might be pulled toward portal
