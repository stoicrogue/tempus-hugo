Absolutely. Here’s a facilitated question set you can use in conversation or survey form to help your players clarify what they want from the rest of the game. It balances emotional check-in, creative curiosity, and forward momentum.

Part 1: Emotional Pulse & Campaign World

1. How are you feeling about the campaign right now?
(Free response or options like: Still energized / A little tired / Burnt out / Curious but overwhelmed / Ready for something new)

2. Do you still want to play in the world of Tempus?

Yes, I’m invested in this world and its stories

Maybe, if we explore a new region or change the tone

I’d prefer a fresh world or genre

Not sure yet


3. What are some aspects of Tempus you still feel excited about?
(e.g., Feywild lore, the Cult, the sword, specific NPCs, magic themes, your character’s arc)

Part 2: Location, Scope, and Focus

4. Do you want to continue with the current storyline ([Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver), sword, the Cult, portals)?

Yes, I want to see how it all resolves

Maybe, if we can speed up or narrow the focus

I'd be fine moving on to something new


5. Would you be interested in exploring another region of the world (e.g., a desert, sea voyage, city intrigue, another plane)?

Yes, I’d love a shift in setting

Only if it ties into our current characters or themes

No, I prefer to stay rooted where we are


6. Would a time skip be appealing to you to help us jump forward to big moments (e.g., reforging Summer’s Edge, the final battle, returning home after it all)?

Yes, I love the idea of fast-forwarding

Maybe, but I’d want a chance to narrate or shape the time skip

No, I’d prefer to play everything out scene by scene

Part 3: Character Arc Closure

7. Do you want your current character’s story to come to a mythic or dramatic close (e.g., legacy, sacrifice, transformation)?

Yes, I’d love a big ending

Maybe, but I’d like to leave the door open

No, I want to keep playing this character

I’m ready to retire them and try something new


8. If your character’s journey ended soon, what kind of ending would feel right for them?
(Free response or ideas: heroic sacrifice, ascension, quiet retirement, becoming a legend, opening a school, vanishing into myth)

9. Would you be open to switching characters or trying something new in the same world or a future version of it?

Yes, that sounds refreshing

Maybe, if it fits the tone and stakes

Not right now

Final Thoughts

10. Is there anything you wish we’d see more or less of in the rest of this campaign?
(Free response)
