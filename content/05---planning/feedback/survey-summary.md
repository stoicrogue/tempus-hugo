Thank you all for your thoughtful responses! Here’s a quick summary of what I heard and what it means for the campaign going forward:

---

**We’re Staying in Tempus**  
Everyone wants to keep playing in the world we’ve built together. There’s strong interest in seeing through key arcs like the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s legacy, Summer’s Edge, and the threat of the Cult. That’s awesome to hear.

**Character Arcs: Mythic Moments Ahead**  
Two of you are excited about giving your current characters big, dramatic conclusions. One is undecided but open, and one wants to continue with their current PC long-term. We’ll be planning for Shad’s exit in a way that’s emotionally powerful and opens the door for a new character connected to factions like the Chained Library or Massa’ista.

**Pacing & Time Skips**  
There’s shared interest in tightening the pacing. A few of you said you’d be happy to skip or fast-forward through less important beats to focus on the big scenes. We’ll look for moments where we can do short time skips, montages, or jump-cuts to make the story feel more cinematic while still honoring slower roleplay when it matters.

**System Curiosity & GM Flexibility**  
While no one’s asking to change systems now, there’s interest in trying other styles (like Dungeon World or Shadowdark) in one-shots or future arcs. Several of you are open to GM rotation or shared worldbuilding if the opportunity arises.

**Next Steps**  
We’ll stay in the world of Tempus and continue through the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) arc, moving toward reforging Summer’s Edge and confronting the portals. Steve will transition to a new character soon, which will give us a great story moment to rally around. I’ll aim to pace things more tightly and keep sessions focused on the emotional and narrative high points.
