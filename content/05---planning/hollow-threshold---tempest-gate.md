# HOLLOW THRESHOLD 1: THE TEMPEST GATE
**Plane Connection:** Material Plane ↔ Elemental Plane of Air

## ARENA LAYOUT
A 50-foot diameter circular platform of black stone floats in howling winds. Lightning crackles between three towering storm-spires (20ft tall, 5ft wide) arranged in a triangle around the center. The **Tempest Egg** hovers 10 feet above the platform's center, wreathed in electrical energy. A shimmering portal to the Material Plane sits at the platform's edge (south), while violent winds from the Air Plane tear through an unstable rift (north).

**Elevation:** Platform (ground level), Storm-spires (20ft), Tempest Egg (10ft above center)

## ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS (Roll d6 each round)
1. **Lightning Surge:** All creatures within 10ft of storm-spires make DC 15 Dex save or take 2d6 lightning damage
2. **Gale Force:** Strong winds push all flying creatures 15ft toward Air Plane portal (DC 15 Str save negates)
3. **Thunder Crack:** All creatures make DC 15 Con save or be stunned until end of next turn
4. **Electrical Overload:** Metal weapons/armor spark - wielders take 1d4 lightning damage, attacks have advantage
5. **Updraft:** All creatures can fly 30ft this round (hover speed)
6. **Calm Eye:** No environmental effects this round
