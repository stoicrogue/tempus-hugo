Behind-the-scenes GM planning documents for larger campaign arcs, encounter design, and ideas that didn't fit neatly into individual session notes. This includes quest outlines, the Hollow Threshold encounters, Chained Library planning, the campaign's final battle design, player feedback surveys, and notes on how AI tools were used during prep.
