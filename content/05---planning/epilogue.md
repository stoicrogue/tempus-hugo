## Immediate Aftermath

As the final blow is delivered, the Weaver’s expression shifts from rage, to confusion, to acceptance. The magic of his ritual slowly vanishes like dust in the wind, leaving behind an echoing silence. The tear in reality stitches itself closed, the wound in fate healing. 

Summer’s Edge burns bright in Skreek’s hands, laying bare the truth of what he and his friends have accomplished.  Slumpet reaches up to his shoulder, feeling for the warmth of the Arbiter’s mark, and catching his breath as he finds it is still there. Toby pats the dust from her jacket and smiles in triumph at her unlikely flameskull ally. Shad collapses to his knees, exhausted and relieved, a sense of closure wrapping around him like a warm blanket as a tear rolls down his cheek. With his friends and family avenged at long last, the weight of the loss, hopes, and dreams feeling easier to carry.

## The Journey

His plans, years in the making, thwarted by the unlikeliest of heroes. They'd started with a father's plea in Tannis—just four strangers who happened to be in the right tavern on the wrong night. But the rescue of one child pulled a thread that unraveled a conspiracy woven over years. They'd battled through corrupted temples and faced down hags over breakfast. They made allies of flameskulls, master smiths, and Elven court barkeeps alike. They'd earned marks from angels and counsel from courts that remembered the world before the last age ended. They'd closed rifts between planes and reforged a sword of legend. And when they sought answers in a library that existed outside time itself, they learned that their quiet guide had been a legend all along—the Knight of Ravens, who'd faced this very darkness three centuries past. Every step, every choice, every victory and loss had been leading them here. To this moment.

## Ripples

With their heroism today, the realm can relax. The barrier is still weak but its secrets no longer lost to time, and no one is ripping it apart. Winry, safe from the cult's shadow, is free to carve her own path. Francis will cackle and quip to his metaphorical heart's content. The Elven courts, shaken from complacency, already begin the work of restoration. The leyline temples will be made whole. The barrier between planes—its secrets no longer lost—can be restored by those with the knowledge and the will. Shad will make sure the world remembers what happened these last 40 days; its an epic ballad begging to be written.

## Epilogue

The stories of our heroes are not over. In the days, weeks, and months that follow... what does each of them seek? Where do they go? What calls to them now?  What does the weave of fate have in store? Will they use their new connections and notoriety, or will they return to the quieter lives of recent past?
