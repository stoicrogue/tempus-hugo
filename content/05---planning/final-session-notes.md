Hi all!  We’re two weeks away from the next, and final, game of the campaign, so I wanted to set expectations and whatnot.  If the date and time no longer work for anyone, please let me know so we can reschedule.

Logistics:
- Game will be played at my house on Feb. 28th @ 12:00PM
	- 2437 Hobblebush Ln. Lake View, NY 14085
- I imagine we’ll start playing closer to 1, after we’ve had a chance to settle in.
- I don’t have a set end-time, but I would imagine it will be a longer session than normal.
- I plan on making a pot of chili and have a good assortment of drinks.

Game Prep:
- Make sure your characters are at level 10.
- This session will primarily be the confrontation with the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) as he attempts a ritual at the next new moon to free [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) from his prison in the Shadowfell.  The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) will be conducting his ritual at the ancient battle site where [Nidhogg](/02---characters/adversaries/nidhogg) was sealed away by the [Order of Seasons](/06---factions/order-of-seasons) centuries ago.
- Last session ended on Nov 25th (in game). The [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver)’s ritual is taking place on Dec 1st (in game).
- The party has 6 in-game days to prep.  If there is any shopping, research, etc that folks would like to do, just send me a message and we can work it out in the next two weeks.
- I want to do a “hot start” where we jump right into the fight with the [Weaver](/02---characters/adversaries/weaver) because I think that will be more dramatic and will make sure we have time to finish the battle without rushing it.
- I would like to end the session with an epilogue where each member of the party has a the opportunity to talk about what their character’s do in the weeks and months that follow the battle.
	- Absolutely no obligation from anyone here, but I thought it might be a good way to wrap up the campaign.

That’s about everything i can think of, but if anyone has any questions let me know.  I’m excited to end the campaign with a bang; it has been a blast seeing all of this unfold!
