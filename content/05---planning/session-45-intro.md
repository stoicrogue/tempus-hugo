## Recap

Guided by the High Druid Faela Mossheart, the party ventured to the Spring Leyline Temple—a massive willow tree whose ancient roots had grown around the sacred entrance. Descending through winding passages within the tree, the party discovered the leyline crystal chamber. The moment they crossed the threshold, waves of necrotic energy assaulted them, forcing a hasty retreat to find Faela and regroup. When Skreek dared peer back into the chamber, he locked eyes with a grotesque hooded figure—a Bodak, its very gaze dealing necrotic damage.

The battle that followed tested them to their limits. The Bodak's death aura pulsed with corrupting power while wraiths and shadows phased through their defenses. Faela fought alongside them, channeling nature's healing as the party slowly turned the tide against the undead horrors. 

As the last shadow dissipated into nothingness, Skreek felt Summer's Edge pulse with radiant warmth in his hand. The blade blazed with brilliant light, as if awakening from a long slumber. In that moment, Skreek understood—the sword had tested him, watched him fight to protect the leyline temple and purge its corruption. The weapon that once belonged to legendary heroes had judged him worthy. Summer's Edge had grown stronger, its bond with Skreek deepening. The blade thrummed with newfound power, eager for the battles yet to come.

Taking stock of the scene after the battle, Slumpetdiscovered a note sewn into the Bodak's robes—a message from Manus. The note revealed chilling truths: the Cult of the Eclipse had grown frustrated with the party's interference. They were abandoning their original plan to wait for the winter solstice. Instead, they would attempt to free Nidhogg at the next new moon—merely ten days away. Manus taunted that the party was becoming more entertaining than the Weaver, and expressed his hope that they would try to stop the Weaver's grand ritual at the ancient battlefield where the shadow dragon was first sealed.

Among the Bodak's possessions, they found gold and a vial of Oil of Etherealness—likely how Manus had smuggled the undead into the sacred chamber. Faela confirmed the Bodak had been the source of the forest's corruption and escorted the weary adventurers back to the Spring Court.

Now the party rests at the Moonlit Hearth tavern, their bodies aching but their resolve strengthened. Tomorrow morning, they will journey with Vael, Fifth Binder and Chainbearer of the Silent Vault, to the entrance of the legendary Chained Library-where they hope to find the knowledge needed to repair the failing barrier before time runs out.

The clock is ticking. Ten days until the new moon. Ten days until Nidhogg's chains may finally break.

# Manus note

> My Dear Feathered Nuisance and Friends,
> 
> You've been deliciously inconvenient! The Weaver is practically pulling his hair out over your little stunt with that Hollow Threshold. Watching him scramble has been the most entertainment I've had in a long time.
> 
> Unfortunately, your meddling means my theatrical friends have decided to rush their grand finale. No more waiting for the winter solstice when the planes practically kiss each other - they're settling for the new moon. 10 days, if my counting is correct. Such impatience.
> 
> I do hope you'll crash their little party. The Weaver plans to execute his grand ritual at the ancient battlefield where Nidhogg was sealed away ages ago. He promised he'd finally duel me once Nidhogg is free, but honestly? I'm starting to think you might give me a better fight. You certainly fight with more style than his shadow-drunk cultists.
> 
> Do try not to die before then. I'd hate to miss the fun.
> 
> With anticipatory bloodlust,  
> Manus
> 
> P.S. - I left this poor fool some company. Consider it a warm-up. You'll need the practice.
