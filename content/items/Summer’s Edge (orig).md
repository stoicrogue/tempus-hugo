## Background

Summer's Edge is an ancient elven sword passed down through generations of the noble and prestigious order of knights known as the Guardians of the Summer Court. The sword was crafted by the finest elven blacksmiths and enchanted by powerful elven mages during a time when the spread of the undead threatened the Summer Court.

The sword's first owner was a legendary elven knight, Eirik of the Summer Court, who led the charge against the undead hordes that threatened the safety of the Summer Court. Eirik was a skilled swordsman and a devoted protector of his people. With the help of Summer's Edge, he and his fellow knights were able to successfully repel the undead invasion and restore peace to the Summer Court.

Over the centuries, Summer's Edge has been wielded by many brave knights who have dedicated their lives to fighting the forces of darkness. It is said that the sword glows with a brilliant golden light when wielded against the undead and that it can only be wielded by those who are pure of heart and steadfast in their commitment to justice and righteousness.

The sword has become a symbol of hope and courage for the people of the Summer Court, and it is believed that as long as the sword remains in the hands of a true Guardian of the Summer Court, the realm will remain safe from the undead and other dark forces that threaten it.

### Summer's Edge (Legendary Weapon)

### Basic Attributes

- **Weapon Type:** Longsword
- **Damage:** 1d8 slashing (versatile 1d10)

### Abilities

1. **Radiant Blade:**
    - Summer's Edge deals an additional 2d6 radiant damage on a hit.
    - Against undead and fiends, it deals an additional 4d6 radiant damage instead.
2. **Sunburst Strike:**
    - Once per long rest, the wielder can use an action to strike the ground with Summer's Edge, creating a burst of radiant energy in a 30-foot radius. All creatures of the wielder's choice within this radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 6d10 radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not blinded. Undead and fiends have disadvantage on this saving throw.
3. **Light of Dawn:**
    - The sword emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can, as a bonus action, intensify this light, causing it to dispel magical darkness and make invisible creatures visible as long as they are within the light's radius.
4. **Sunfire Blade:**
    - As a bonus action, the wielder can ignite the blade with sunfire, causing it to deal an additional 1d8 fire damage on a hit for 1 minute. This ability can be used once per short or long rest.
5. **Daylight's Wrath:**
    - The wielder can cast the **Daylight** spell (spell save DC 17) from the sword once per long rest.
6. **Legendary Resistance (1/day):**
    - If the wielder fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead. This reflects the unyielding will imbued in the blade to protect against the shadow dragon's influence.
7. **Searing Smite:**
    - The wielder can cast **Searing Smite** at 4th level once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
8. **Radiant Shield:**
    - As a reaction, when the wielder is hit by an attack, they can use the sword to create a shield of radiant light, granting them +5 to AC until the start of their next turn. This ability can be used once per short or long rest.
9. **Aura of Radiance:**
    - While attuned to Summer's Edge, the wielder exudes an aura of radiant energy that inspires and protects their allies.
    - **Effect:** Allies within 30 feet of the wielder gain the following benefits:
        - **Protection:** They have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects created by undead or fiends.
        - **Healing Light:** At the start of each of their turns, allies regain hit points equal to the wielder’s Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if they have less than half of their hit points remaining.
        - **Inspiration:** Allies add a +1 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws while within the aura.
10. **Radiant Bastion:**
    - The wielder can invoke the power of Summer's Edge to shield and bolster their allies.
    - **Effect:** Once per long rest, as an action, the wielder can activate Radiant Bastion, creating a protective barrier of radiant energy around them and their allies. For 1 minute:
        - Allies within 30 feet gain +2 to AC.
        - Allies within 30 feet are immune to being frightened and gain resistance to necrotic damage.
        - Allies who start their turn within 30 feet gain temporary hit points equal to the wielder’s Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Flavor and Lore

- **Sentience:** The sword could have a fragment of the soul or essence of a powerful celestial, giving it a personality that communicates telepathically with its wielder.
- **History:** When held, the sword occasionally grants the wielder brief visions of the ancient battle against the shadow dragon, providing hints or inspiration related to their current quest.
