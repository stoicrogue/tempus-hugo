> [!quote] First Sparks
> Today, I cast an illusion no one could see through.  Father called it child's play — a trick for fairs and fools. But when I showed him the wolf at the window and watched the blood drain from his face, I knew: there is power in belief. 
>  
>  Even without substance, fear is real.

>[!quote] The Dance of Triggers
> Why rely on an audience’s gaze? Why perform for them when I can weave cause and effect into the very fabric of a place?  I have found a method to bind illusions to events — a sound, a footstep, a heartbeat. They spring to life when I command them, like faithful servants awaiting their cue. I call it a "programmed illusion."  
> 
> The thrill of setting a trap no blade can cut... intoxicating.

>[!quote] Living Echoes
> The illusions can be more than simple images. I shape their movements, their words, their reactions.  I build performances so convincing that even I forget they are false until I will them gone.  Emotion deepens the weave. Anger strengthens it. Fear makes it linger.  
> 
> The house listens. The house remembers.

>[!quote] Beyond the Curtain
> I glimpsed it today — a vast tapestry, not of image but of reality itself. A landscape reshaped, a castle dissolved and rebuilt in the span of a breath.  The spell is called Mirage Arcane.  It requires not only will but dominion over truth and lie alike.  
> 
> When I master this, my enemies will not simply see what is false—they will **live** in it, until they forget what was ever real.

>[!quote] The Last Thread
> There is no truth but what I weave. Their minds, their senses, their hearts — all are threads for my loom.  Let them come. Let them wander halls of sorrow, fields of ash, towers built on screams.  
> 
> In this place, even hope is but an illusion.

> [!quote] Fate-touched Paper
> _Silmirien_ — I have named it thus, a tether of light woven through ink and intention. 
> 
> Should this book ever slip from my hands—or worse, from my mind—it will call to me. Not loudly. Not always clearly. But surely, like dawn through mist.  
> 
> The spell is delicate. It requires a piece of the whole—no mere duplicate, but a splinter drawn from the pages themselves, thinned with care and treated with moon-milk and shadowroot. Then, it is bound with a name I no longer speak.  
> 
> A name written in invisible ink. A name that sleeps… until the light of a true moon wakes it.  
> 
> I carry the tether with me always—stitched into my sleeve, close to my skin, where I can feel it thrum with my heartbeat.  As long as I live, it will guide me back to this book.  But if I am lost… burn the page. Its smoke will find me. Its flame will call me home.

>[!quote] The First Thread Pulled
> The Courts are blind in their rituals. They tend the barrier like farmers tending a crumbling dam — repairing cracks without ever questioning why the waters rise.
>
> The leyline anchors... they are not invincible. They are **woven constructs**, made by mortal hands long ago, when fear drove them to bind the world in false light. I have walked the temples. I have touched the crystals. I have seen the strands of magic binding them to this plane. Weaken one, and the others strain. Break one, and the whole weave begins to unravel.
> 
> The Elders would call it heresy. Treason. Madness.  They would be wrong.
> 
> In the unraveling, truth waits. In the loosening of bonds, Nidhogg stirs. The path is clear. I need only find the correct threads to pull.
> 
> When the time is right, I shall leave this hollow house behind. My true work must be done elsewhere — far from prying eyes, where the new weave can begin.

> [!tip] If His True Name is Revealed and Spoken
> Under the moonlight, the ink on the page shimmers and reveals a name that almost sings itself into the night air—soft, melodic, but _unmistakably elven_. When spoken aloud, something in the room tightens. The journal snaps closed. All light dims for a breath.
> 
> Then, every remaining page flutters, and from their shifting surfaces, a **voice**—his voice—emerges. Calm. Hollow. Prepared.
> 
> “If you’ve come this far, then you already know too much. Or perhaps… you know enough. Enough to stop me. Or to join me.”
> 
> A final illusion takes form. Not a memory this time, but a _message_. A standing echo of the Weaver, still masked, but weary.
> 
> He explains just enough: his location is hidden behind a veiled fold in the Feywild, reachable only when three conditions are met—something like “a thread severed, a name spoken, and a light uncast.” These become the party’s next puzzle.
> 
> **Optional twist:** As the name is spoken, the Silmirien page _regrows itself_ from the ashes, forming anew, and now points unwaveringly in a specific direction. The tether is reformed—but now _the party holds the other end._


> [!tip] True Name
> The name is elvish and beautiful—perhaps _Aelthirion_. Or _Valesarin_. Or a soft syllabled secret that carries melancholy in its phonemes.


> [!info] Silmirien
> **Silmirien** – "silmi" (gleam/light) + "rien" (woven) — _a woven gleam or tether of memory_
> - The page bound with his **true name** is subtly different—thicker, slightly glossy, odorless. 
> - It radiates faint warmth when held at night.
> - The name is written in ink made of **moon-milk and shadowroot**—visible only under moonlight.
> - The name is elvish and beautiful—perhaps _Aelthirion_.
