_Weapon (dagger), rare_

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to causeÂ a necrotic aura to coat the blade. The aura remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 necrotic damage. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

Proficiency with a dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
