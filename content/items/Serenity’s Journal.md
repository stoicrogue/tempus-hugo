“I've never encountered a creature of such sorrow and powerful longing. If only I could share the depth of his darkness with the realm…”

“I can't be the only one to have been engaged by the beauty of his darkness. I must find someone who understands my experiences.”

“the dusk lord?!? What a joke. His suffering would surely please the great shadow… would it not?”

“I knew it! My lord’s hatred for the ‘god’ runs deep. I must find a way to make them suffer. The curse the Weaver taught me would be perfect!!! Time to gather my supplies. Now… what face to wear when I go to town? The artist? The beggar? The warrior? No…the singer would be just the thing!  She always gets attention and I feel like showing off a bit”

“The darklings have their uses. They were certainly motivated enough by the promise of power from the great shadow… I have seen many pixies around. Maybe they could harvest first for me? No need for it now, but it is an intriguing substance. I'm sure I'll find a use for it eventually. And if not, at least I will get to enjoy the tiny creatures suffering”
