_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This inky-dark bag glimmers softly in daylight and shines like a star in darkness, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Inside the bag is complete darkness. The bag has 3 charges, and regains all spent charges daily at dawn.

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to reach inside and catch a handful of starlight like sand. This starlight can be used in either of the following ways:

**_Starlight Veil:_** As an action, you can throw one handful of starlight out in front of you in a 10-foot-cone. Any creatures caught in this cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are outlined in shining starlight. Objects in the cone automatically fail this save and are similarly outlined. Any affected creature or object cannot benefit from being invisible.

**_Whispers of the Spheres:_** As an action, you can use one handful of starlight to cast the sending spell by whispering into the starlight and letting the wind snatch it from your open palm.

Once 3 handfuls of starlight have been pulled from the bag, the bag canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
