## Arcanroot Tobacco Pipe

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This pipe comes with a pouch containing 27 (5d10) pinches of arcanroot tobacco.

As an action, you can consume one pinch to pack it into the pipe.

As a bonus action, you can light the pipe and blow the smoke onto a solid surface or object.

The smoke forms into a 1-foot diameter ring out to a range of 30 feet, which lasts 5 minutes.

The inside of the ring reveals what is within the object or on the other side of a solid surface. The vision will only penetrate the surface that is in contact with the smoke ring.

The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.
