## Session Notes

- Having cleared the castle of all known threats, the party decided to spend the night to rest before making the journey back to the material plane.
- When they wake the next day, the castle is much less creepy and much more normal.  The flickering illusions are all but gone and color has come back to the castle.  Exploring the house in the daylight, they discover chambers they hadn't noticed before, including stairs leading up to bedchambers.
- A hidden tapestry conceals a narrow spiral stair descending beneath the castle. The stairway walls shift from elegant illusions to rough ancient stone. The chamber is a natural dome of untouched bedrock with faint quartz veins.
- A tall obsidian standing stone stands at the center with a needle-eye hole near its top. The party recognizes this as exactly like the standing stones they have used for teleportation in the elven forest.  Skreek notices a traditional arcane teleportation circle is inscribed around the stoneâ€™s base, dusty but intact. He remembers seeing one of these in the royal castle of his homeland, but doesn't know how to operate it.
- The air feels unnaturally still, heavy with ancient leyline energy. The chamber feels older than the castle, as if the castle was built to guard it.
- As the party examines the chamber, the patchwork guardian they encountered outside appears and tells the party they are the new owners of the castle now that they have defeated the Weaver's Echo.  The party debates what to call the guardian and they decide to to call him Jeeves for simplicity.  Jeeves tells them he will work on restoring the castle and that he can shape it to their needs if given time and materials.  Toby asks if they can do anything for Jeeves and he requests the party brings him something nice to plant in the royal gardens.
- Slumpet attunes the leyline gate ring to the standing stone and the party uses the stone to teleport back to the Summer Court.
- Once in the Summer Court, the party goes to Elara's forge.  She is glad to see them and tells the party it has been almost 3 weeks since they left and she was beginning to worry.  Shad's hair has returned to normal, the effects of the Fey magic that had turned it to vines seemingly has run its course.  The same for the magic influencing Toby and Skreek.  Toby is no longer laughing uncontrollable and Skreek no longer needs to speak in rhymes.
- Elara confirms they have gathered the "first kiss of the midday sun" and escorts them to an ancient forge beneath her shop.  She says reforging Summer's Edge deserves a special forge closer to the leylines. With the "first kiss" and the celestial ore, she begins the reforging by saying "Your light will burn again - The realms still need you."  When she finishes her work, she asks who will take up the blade.  The party all point at Skreek.  He steps forward and accepts Summer's Edge.  As he grips the completed blade for the first time, Skreek felt the bladeâ€™s resolve wash through himâ€”pure, wordless gratitude and unbreakable purpose. Not a voice, not yet, but a promise. Together, they would stand against the dark. Together, they would bring dawn.
- Elara gives Skreek a simple scabbard for the sword and briefly discusses designs for a more fitting scabbard with Skreek.  They party tells Elara they are off to Ember's Embrace to relax and plan their next moves.  Elara tells them she will meet them at the bar after she tidies up a bit.
- At the Ember's Embrace, they party got some interesting drinks from [[Serra Flamekissed]] and debated their next move.  They remembered a standing stone near the [[Order of Seasons Tomb]] and decided they could use it to make the journey to see how Tannis is holding up.  They haven't been back since they found the source of the darkness curse and heard that the [[Arbiter]] was going to lift the barrier keeping the curse from spreading.  Before going to bed, Shad did some shopping and purchased a scroll of legend lore, which used up a sizeable amount of his coin.
