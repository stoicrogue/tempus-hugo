## Vael's Intro

> “I am a witness. An agent of balances long frayed. My name is Vael. Fifth Binder. Chainbearer of the Silent Vault. When minds shatter against what they should not know, we are the ones who pick up the pieces. Or burn them. Some truths are too dangerous to be carried, so we bury them in silence—where even their echoes find no ears.”
> 
> "I’ve studied the tears in the veil. This one”—he gestured to the now-absent portal—“was particularly volatile. I was… considering my options.”
> 
> Vael stepped closer. The sunlight didn’t seem to touch him.
>  
> “You carry something dangerous.” His gaze flicked to the pack where Slumpet kept Serenity’s orb, though the orb itself was hidden. “It has already drawn things to you. It will draw more. If you intend to keep walking this path, you will need knowledge. Forbidden knowledge. And perhaps... a key.”
