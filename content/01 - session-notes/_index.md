> - Prep notes for individual sessions.
> - These evolved over time and I find what worked best for me at the table.
> - Originally, I used my iPad at the table to access my prep notes in Notion. I included links to D&D Beyond for monsters and split content into different Notion pages, like pages for individual monsters or locations.
> - In a effort to be more present at the table, I changed my approach and only worked off a set of printed notes. One or two pages if I could get away with it.
> - I now take in-game notes on these printed pages and transfer anything important back to Obsidian after the session.
