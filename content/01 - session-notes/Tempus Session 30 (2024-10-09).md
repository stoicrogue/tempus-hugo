# Monsters

  

### **Deadly Encounter Benchmark**

_Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below._

# Treasure

### Session Notes

- Visit the coliseum and take note of upcoming events
- Investigate the summer leyline temple
- Find it has been broken into already, guardians defeated and a crystal stolen
- Encountered the thief outside as they left. Disguised as Trius but revealed to be am assassin named Manus working with the cult of the eclipse.
- Manus gave them the crystal back after challenging the party to land a hit on him. The party cheated in Manus’ eyes by throwing a handful of ball bearings at him, but he honored the deal.
- Manus seemed to be helping the cult but not committed to their goals. He seemed to be more interested in finding powerful foes
