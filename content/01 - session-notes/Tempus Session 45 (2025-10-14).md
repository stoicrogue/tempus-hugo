## NPCs

### Samaris
Samaris, an ancient tiefling with long black horns, is the oldest of the librarians. She despises every book in the library and dreams nightly about setting fire to the entire collection for the good of the world. Samaris mistrusts anyone who asks to read one of the books and sends agents of the library to shadow visitors after they leave, waiting for those guests to prove their corruption so she can order their assassination.

### Alois
The young human Alois is the newest addition to the library’s staff. They arrived the same way all the librarians do: following a calling in their dreams. Alois isn’t convinced that the books they guard are evil: they are, after all, just books. When they can, Alois slips into the Howling Shelves and browses the texts there. They haven’t yet had an opportunity to venture into the Deep Stacks, but one day they will.
