> Leyline Temple of the [[Spring Court]]

- **Visual Design:**
    - Grown, not built — the temple appears as a massive flowering tree whose trunk is hollowed into spiraling corridors.
    - Light filters through translucent petals and mossy skylights. Water flows upward in some places, spiraling like vines.
    - The leyline crystal pulses like a budding heart encased in glassy bark.
- **Magical Function:**
    - Anchors the leyline through regenerative, life-giving magic.
    - Currently **disrupted** by one or more nearby **Hollow Thresholds**, corrupting the area’s natural growth cycles.
- **Proposed Party Interaction:**
    - **The Seed Ritual:** Faela gives each party member a seed and asks them to plant it in soil around the temple. Each seed binds to the person’s “intent to grow” — a personal resolution or change they vow to make.
        - Doing so links their essence to the Spring leyline.
        - The seeds sprout into flowers reflecting the character’s spirit — their color, condition, and behavior reveal emotional states (this can lead to some great narrative moments).
    - **Disrupted Growth:** The leyline crystal is “choked” by spiritual brambles — they will not recede until the surrounding Hollow Thresholds are closed. Only then can the Spring temple be re-anchored.

## Leyline Temple

- [[Faela Mossheart]] will each give the party a seed, which they will need to plant outside the temple, making a contract with themselves to make a positive change in their lives.
	- **Tangible Consequences**: Make the growth of each seed magically visible, reflecting the character’s progress. (E.g., it blossoms later in the story if they live true to the promise.)
	- **Reflection Prompts**: Ask each player to define the nature of their personal commitment aloud before planting—Faela’s magic could force them to speak only truth.
- The party finds the leyline energies are being disrupted by the hollow thresholds.  The nearby ones will need to be closed to cleanse the area before the barrier can be re-anchored here.
	- **Sensory Detail of Disruption**: the leyline “feels” corrupted to Faela—the rhythm is arrhythmic, like a heartbeat out of sync with springtime cycles.
	- **Visible Signs of Decay**: New growth around the temple is twisted or withered. Flowers bloom only to rot. The only flowers blooming naturally are ones planted in the ritual location. Birds avoid the area. The ground is unnaturally cold.
	- A Bodak is inside the leyline crystal chamber.
