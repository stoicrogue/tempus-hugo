Nestled at the edge of the winter realm, the elven outpost stands adorned with ethereal silver banners, glinting like frost-kissed moonlight. Before you rises an awe-inspiring silver maple, its branches reaching skyward over 100 feet, crystalline leaves gently whispering the tales of ancient winters. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of pine and a distant promise of snow. Ice sculptures depicting elven lore flank the entrance, guiding visitors toward the heart of the Winter Court's domain.
