## Background

- **Themes:** renewal, new beginnings, creation
- **Leader:** High Druid Faela Mossheart
- **Landmarks:**
	- Endless Meadow
	- Grand Windmill

## Leyline Temple

- Faela will each give the party a seed, which they will need to plant outside the temple, making a contract with themselves to make a positive change in their lives.
	- **Tangible Consequences**: Make the growth of each seed magically visible, reflecting the character’s progress. (E.g., it blossoms later in the story if they live true to the promise.)
	- **Reflection Prompts**: Ask each player to define the nature of their personal commitment aloud before planting—Faela’s magic could force them to speak only truth.
- The party finds the leyline energies are being disrupted by the hollow thresholds.  The nearby ones will need to be closed to cleanse the area before the barrier can be re-anchored here.
	- **Sensory Detail of Disruption**: the leyline “feels” corrupted to Faela—the rhythm is arrhythmic, like a heartbeat out of sync with springtime cycles.
	- **Visible Signs of Decay**: New growth around the temple is twisted or withered. Flowers bloom only to rot. The only flowers blooming naturally are ones planted in the ritual location. Birds avoid the area. The ground is unnaturally cold.
